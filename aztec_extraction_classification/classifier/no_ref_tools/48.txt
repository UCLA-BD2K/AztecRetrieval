To quantify cis- vs. trans-regulatory contributions to mammalian regulatory evolution, we performed genomic DNase I footprinting of the mouse genome across 25 cell and tissue types, collectively defining >8.6 million TF occupancy sites at nucleotide resolution. Here we show that mouse TF footprints encode a regulatory lexicon of >600 motifs that is >95% similar with that recognized in vivo by human TFs. However, only ~20% of mouse TF footprints have human orthologues. Despite substantial turnover of the cis-regulatory landscape around each TF gene, nearly half of all pairwise regulatory interactions connecting mouse TF genes have been maintained in orthologous human cell types through evolutionary innovation of TF recognition sequences. Strikingly, the higher-level organization of mouse TF-to-TF connections into cellular network architectures is nearly identical with human. Our results suggest that evolutionary selection on mammalian gene regulation is targeted chiefly at the level of trans-regulatory circuitry.
==== Body
Gene regulation is classically partitioned into cis- and trans-acting compartments, which are in turn integrated to form a regulatory network. The cis compartment comprises DNA elements that encode transcription factor (TF) recognition sites, while the trans encompasses hundreds of TF genes and their DNA recognition repertoires. The cross-regulation of TF genes by one another creates a regulatory network that potentiates complex decision-making and confers robustness at the cellular and higher levels1.

In metazoan genomes, actuatable TF recognition sites are clustered into compact regulatory DNA regions that give rise to DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) upon TF occupancy in place of a canonical nucleosome2. Mice and humans diverged ~90MYA3, and an extensive survey of mouse DHSs indicates that the cis-regulatory DNA compartment has diverged markedly since the last common ancestor4, generalizing and extending observations from a small number of TFs assayed by ChIP-seq in one or a few tissues5,6. However, it is currently unknown how dynamic are individual TF recognition elements within broader regulatory regions, or how cis-regulatory dynamics relate to the conservation of higher level cellular and physiological features that define mammals. Early studies of individual regulatory elements in drosophila7 and zebrafish8 indicate a potential for functional conservation without sequence conservation, but their generality and relevance for mammalian evolution is unclear.

Genomic DNaseI footprinting enables systematic delineation of TF-DNA interactions at nucleotide resolution and on a global scale9–11, permitting: (i) the simultaneous interrogation of hundreds of DNA-binding TFs expressed in a given cell type in a single experiment; (ii) de novo derivation of the cis-regulatory lexicon of an organism; and (iii) systematic mapping of TF-to-TF cross-regulatory networks1.

Pervasive turnover of DNaseI footprints
To delineate an expansive set of specific mouse genomic sequence elements contacted by TFs in vivo, we performed genomic DNaseI footprinting9,10 on 25 diverse mouse cell and tissue types (Extended Data Table 1). From an average of 323 million uniquely mapped DNaseI cleavages per cell type, we identified an average of ~1 million high-confidence (FDR 1%10,11) DNaseI footprints (6- to 40-bp), and a total of 8.6 million differentially occupied footprints (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a). DNaseI footprints were highly reproducible (Extended Data Fig. 1b) and robust to any intrinsic DNaseI cleavage propensities (Extended Data Fig. 2).

To study the evolutionary divergence in TF occupancy patterns between mouse and human we compared mouse DNaseI footprint maps with those from 41 diverse human cell types10,12 using pairwise alignments of the mouse and human genomes to map mouse DNaseI footprints to the human genome (Fig. 1b). In total, 65% of mouse TF footprints could be localized within the human genome, comparable to the cross-alignment rate of entire ~150bp DHSs4 (Fig. 1c). However, whereas 35% of mouse DHSs have human orthologs that are also DNaseI-hypersensitive in at least one human cell type4, only 22% of mouse TF footprints have human sequence orthologs that are occupied in any of human cell types assayed (Fig. 1c). This indicates that the individual DNA elements within DHSs that are directly contacted by TFs in vivo have undergone extensive turnover since the last common ancestor of mouse and human.

Conservation of TF recognition lexicon
We next explored the evolutionary stability of the mammalian TF recognition repertoire encompassed within mouse and human TF footprints. At occupied sites for a given TF, footprinting data closely recapitulates TF ChIP-seq data10,11, (Extended Data Fig. 3), and per-nucleotide DNaseI-cleavage profiles mirror the morphology of the DNA-protein binding interface10,11,13. Examination of cleavage profiles at occupied sites for diverse TFs showed these to be nearly identical between mouse and human cell types (Fig. 2a), indicating that in vivo DNA recognition preferences for these TFs have experienced little change between mouse and human.

Performing de novo motif discovery on the DNaseI footprint compartment can derive the cis-regulatory lexicon of an organism10. To investigate comprehensively the divergence of mouse and human TF lexica, we performed de novo motif discovery on the 8.6 million mouse TF footprints. In total, we defined 604 unique motif models (Fig. 2b), of which 355 (59%) matched models present within motif databases and 249 were novel (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Comparison of known and novel mouse-derived motif models to motif models derived de novo from human DNaseI footprints10 revealed that >94% of the collective TF lexicon is conserved between mouse and humans (Fig. 2c). The fact that TF footprints in mouse and human contain nearly identical recognition sequence repertoires indicates that regulatory divergence between mouse and humans has occurred almost entirely at the level of individual TF-binding cis-regulatory elements.

22 novel motif models were selective for the mouse lineage and 14 selective for the human lineage (Fig. 2c). The 22 novel mouse-selective motifs are found chiefly in distal elements (Extended Data Fig. 4b), where they populate ~2% of DNaseI footprint and show cell/tissue-specific occupancy, predominantly for mouse ES cells (Fig. 2d–e). This suggests that the TFs recognizing these elements may play important roles in very early development, when humans and rodents show more differences than at later stages14, and further highlights the role of distal gene regulation in species divergence15. Notably, whereas sequence matches to the 14 human-selective models in human DNaseI footprints showed strong human-specific evolutionary constraint10,16 (Fig. 2f), nucleotide diversity at sequence matches to the 22 mouse-selective models in human DNaseI footprints showed significantly reduced human-specific evolutionary constraint (P<0.05) (Fig. 2f), consistent with a loss of TF occupancy (and selective pressure) due to divergence (or loss) of the cognate factor within the human lineage.

Conservation of TF-to-TF connections
We next sought to characterize the core mouse TF regulatory network, and to compare its features with the human TF network. Genomic footprinting provides a direct and empirical approach for mapping the core TF regulatory network of an organism comprising cross-regulatory interactions (network edges) between TF genes (network nodes)1. Footprint-anchored TF regulatory networks precisely recapitulate well-validated TF-to-TF regulatory connections1,17, and are agnostic to whether any given TF-to-TF regulatory interaction is positive (activating) or negative (repressive), as these may vary conditionally even for a given TF. Following the approach of Neph et al.1, we mapped mouse TF-to-TF networks connecting 586 mouse TF genes with known recognition sequences within each of the 25 cell/tissue types (Fig. 3a). This disclosed an average of 22,970 unique TF-to-TF edges per cell type, totaling 77,084 unique edges across all 25 cell types. Differences between cell types derived from both the cell-selective usage of TFs, as well as the cell-selective occupancy patterns of these TFs. For example, the neuronal developmental regulator OTX2 is selective for neuronal tissue, but its connectivity/occupancy patterns differ between functionally distinct neuronal cell/tissue types (Fig. 3b).

Mouse TF regulatory networks from functionally similar cell and tissue types are coherently organized into anatomic and functional groups (Fig. 3c), analogous to results from human TF regulatory networks1. However, although the similarity (pairwise Jaccard indices) between all mouse and human networks was maximal between orthologous mouse-human cell and tissue pairs (Fig. 3d,e), network differences within each species were smaller than differences between species (Fig. 3e).

We next asked to what extent specific mouse TF-to-TF regulatory connections were conserved in human. We first identified TF-to-TF connections that were mouse-specific, human-specific or shared across both orthologous human and mouse cell types (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Table 2). We then differentiated shared regulatory edges (i.e., present in both a mouse cell type and its human ortholog) arising from TF occupancy of an orthologous binding element from shared edges arising from occupancy of a non-orthologous sequence element within regulatory DNA of the orthologous target gene (Fig. 4a). In the former case, both sequence and circuitry are conserved; in the latter, circuitry only. Overall, ~44% of the TF-to-TF regulatory connections are significantly conserved between orthologous mouse and human cell types (p<0.001) (Fig. 4b). However, >40% of these connections represent edges created by TF binding to a novel sequence element arising since mouse-human divergence (Fig. 4b). As such, conservation of functional regulatory circuitry is considerably greater than indicated by sequence conservation alone.

Conservation of TF network architecture
We next compared the overall architecture of mouse and human TF networks. The architecture of complex networks can be analyzed in terms of simple regulatory circuit ‘building blocks’ termed network motifs, such as the feed-forward loop (FFL)18. In human, despite the general selectivity of specific TF-to-TF edges for specific cell types, the pattern of utilization of three-node network motifs within each individual cell type network is nearly identical1. Computing network motif utilization within each of the 25 mouse TF networks also revealed uniform network motif utilization patterns across mouse cell/tissue type regulatory networks (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Strikingly, these patterns are nearly identical with human, indicating that mouse and human TF networks utilize virtually the same architecture (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 5).

To analyze evolutionary conservation at the level of individual regulatory circuits, we identified all instances of each three-node network motif within each mouse cell type, extracted the constituent TFs, and computed how the same TFs were connected in orthologous human cell types. Despite the conservation of overall network architecture between mouse and humans, this analysis revealed that the specific combinations of TFs comprising individual regulatory circuits have undergone substantial remodeling between mouse and human (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 6). Overall, 39% of combinations of three TFs found within one or more three-node circuits in a given mouse cell type were also organized into at least one type of three-node circuit in an orthologous human cell type (Extended Data Fig. 6b). For example, >25% of three-TF combinations organized into ‘regulating mutual’ circuits were conserved between orthologous mouse and human cell types, whereas only 8% of three-TF combinations that form ‘mutual-and-three-chain’ circuits show such conservation. By contrast, 12% of three-TF combinations that form ‘mutual-and-three-chain’ circuits lose one cross-regulatory interaction, transforming them into FFL circuits in orthologous human cell types (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 6c). Collectively, TF circuits conserved between mouse and human were significantly enriched in four major network motif types: (i) the FFL motif; (ii) the ‘regulated mutual’ motif; (iii) the ‘regulating mutual’ (RM) motif; and (iv) the ‘clique’ motif (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 6c). As such, these circuits appear to comprise the most vital building blocks of mammalian TF regulatory architectures.

Conserved TF positions within networks
We next asked to what degree the position of a specific TF within a given network motif circuit was conserved between mouse and human. To analyze this, we focused on FFL and RM circuits, as these are both strongly conserved overall and have a clear top-down hierarchical organization (Fig. 5a,b). Computation of the propensity for each TF (of 586) to occupy each of the nodes within these network motifs revealed that the preferred position of a given TF within FFL and RM circuits is strongly conserved between orthologous human and mouse cell types (Fig. 5c,d). It also revealed conserved preferential positioning of entire classes of TFs within particular network motif positions. For example, TFs with ubiquitous cellular functions such as Ctcf, Sp1 and Nrf1 systematically localize within the driver positions of FFL and RM circuits (Fig. 5c,d), while TFs involved in cell lineage fate decisions (e.g., Sox2, Nfe2, and Foxp3) preferentially localized within the final passenger positions (Fig. 5c,d and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). We also found the passenger edges of FFL and RM motifs to be significantly more cell-selective than the driver edges (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). These findings raise the possibility that one of the major functions of conserved mammalian network motifs may be to stabilize the expression of TFs that drive cell type-specific regulatory programs via exploitation of stable cell-ubiquitous regulatory interactions.

A conserved developmental program
To explore how the TF regulatory network interacts with downstream non-TF structural/effector genes and to test for conserved interactions, we first quantified, for each TF, whether it preferentially regulates another TF gene(s) or a non-TF ‘structural’ gene(s) across different mouse and human cell types (Extended Data Fig. 8a). This parameter varied widely between different TFs; in general, TFs involved in development state specification such as Hoxb1, Oct4 and Sox2 preferentially regulated other TF genes, while general transcriptional regulators such as Nrf1, Ctcf and Sp1 preferentially regulated non-TF genes (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). To test how these preferences varied by cell type, we averaged TF gene vs. structural gene propensities for all TFs within each cell-type regulatory network. This revealed that the TF networks of pluripotent and early developmental cell types and tissues such as ES cells and fetal brain were globally significantly more oriented towards regulation of TF genes compared with the TF networks of more highly differentiated cell types (e.g. B-cells, T-cells) and tissues (e.g., adult brain) (Extended Data Fig. 8d). These TF vs. structural gene preferences – both at the individual TF level and at the cell-type regulatory network level – were strongly conserved between mouse and human (Extended Data Fig. 8d,e). These findings suggest the operation of a conserved global developmental regulatory program that directs a shift in the orientation of TF regulatory networks from TFs to structural genes during the transition from primitive to definitive cells.

Taken together, our results expose several major organizing principles of mammalian gene regulation, and a fundamental hierarchy in the modes of evolutionary transmission of regulatory information, ranging from poor conservation of cis-acting sequence elements to the preservation of trans-acting regulatory features (Fig. 6). Conservation of trans-acting components is reflected both in the recognition repertoires of human and mouse TFs, which differ only slightly (~5%), and in the conserved patterns of TF-to-gene interactions. The dichotomy between cis- and trans-acting regulatory components is most apparent in the context of the core TF regulatory network. Whereas the individual DNA bases contacted by TFs in vivo have undergone extensive turnover since the last common ancestor of mouse and human, the repertoire of TFs regulating other TF genes is vastly more conserved. Notably, the cis vs. trans disparity in mammals greatly eclipses that previously described for different drosophila species19.

At the TF network level, organization of the regulatory circuitry in both mouse and human cell types appears to be governed by common principles that result in virtually indistinguishable network architectures (Fig. 6). Conserved shifts in TF network orientation during the transition from primitive to definitive cells in both organisms suggest that the mammalian regulatory architecture may have evolved around a central goal of guiding cell identity during development.

Collectively, our results indicate that evolutionary selection on gene regulation is targeted chiefly at the level of regulatory networks, and explain how essential features of the mammalian body plan and physiology have been maintained in the face of massive turnover of the cis-regulatory landscape.

METHODS
Genomic footprinting
Mouse cell and tissue types were subjected to DNaseI digestion and high-throughput sequencing, following previous methods20. 36bp sequence tags were aligned to the reference genome, build NCBI37/mm9, using Bowtie 3, version 0.12.7 with parameters: –mm -n 3 -v 3 -k 2, and –phred33-quals. DNaseI footprint discovery and false discovery rate estimation were performed as previously described10 using 36-mer sequencing reads and unique mappability information for mouse, build NCBI37/mm9 (available at http://www.uwencode.org/proj/hotspot/). The number and proportion of all DNaseI cleavages that fell within DNaseI hotspot regions were calculated as previously described20 (Extended Data Table 1).

To identify the total cohort of DNA elements contained within mouse FDR 1% DNaseI footprints we first computed the multi-set union of all footprints across all cell types using BEDOPS21. For each element of the union, we then collected all significantly overlapping footprints, which were defined as those footprints with 65% or more of their bases in common with the element (bedmap --fraction-map 0.65). A footprint’s genomic coordinates were redefined to the minimum and maximum coordinates from its overlap set (bedmap --echo-map-range), which always included the footprint itself. All redefined footprints from the union then passed through a subsumption and uniqueness filter: when a footprint was genomically contained within another, the filter discarded the smaller of the two or selected just one footprint if identical. Footprints passing through the filter comprised the final set of 8.6 million combined footprints across all cell types. Unlike footprints from any single cell type, the combined set included overlapping footprints. We further computed the number of cell types from which each of these 8.6 million combined footprints were derived. To identify the reproducibility of a DNaseI footprint, we calculated for every sample the proportion of DNaseI footprints that were independently discovered in 1 or more other samples from the same species using an overlap criterion of 25% (bedmap --fraction-either 0.25).

Accounting for intrinsic DNaseI cleavage preferences
Using deeply mapped DNaseI cleavage preferences22, we analyzed each FDR 1% footprint in a representative mouse (heart) and human (SkMC) cell/tissue type and counted the total number of mapped tags falling in each footprint and the left and right flanking regions. We then randomly assigned the same number of simulated tags to positions within these regions, using probabilities proportional to the DNaseI cut-rate bias model for the sequence context surrounding each position. A new footprint-occupancy score (FOS) was calculated over the same L, C and R regions as before10 and compared to the FOS value of the original footprint. Footprints that showed smaller FOS values using the DNaseI cut-rate bias model were considered false-positive footprints. The proportion of false-positive footprints with FOS smaller than that computed from the uncorrected data was <1%.

Correspondence of DNaseI footprint and ChIP-seq datasets
Motif models (from TRANSFAC, JASPAR Core, and UniPROBE) were used in conjunction with the FIMO motif scanning software23, version 4.6.1 using a P < 1e-5 threshold, to find all motif instances of Ctcf (Transfac model V_CTCF_01), Gata1 (Jaspar model MA0035.2-Gata1), Max (Jaspar model MA0058.1-MAX), Myc (Jaspar model MA0147.1-Myc), and Tbp (Transfac model V_TATA_01) within DNaseI hotspots of the MEL cell line. We buffered (+/− 30 nt) discovered motif instances and counted at each base position within the buffered motif the number of uniquely mapping DNaseI sequencing reads with a 5’ end mapping to that position. We sorted buffered motif instances by their total counts, and then normalized each instance’s counts to a mean value of 0 and variance 1. A heatmap, with 1 row per motif instance, was generated using matrix2png24, version 1.2.1. A 46-species phyloP evolutionary conservation score heatmap over the same ordered motif instances and bases was generated using the same processing techniques. Motif instances that overlapped DNaseI footprints by at least 3 nt were annotated. Uniformly processed mm9 MEL ChIP-seq peaks were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser web site and motif instances overlapping ChIP-seq peaks by at least 3 nt were also annotated.

Identification of orthologous human sequence at mouse footprints
We aligned the coordinates for the 8.6 million combined mouse footprints to the human genome using the “over chain” best pairwise alignment file available from the UCSC Genome Browser. Mouse footprints with 50% or more of their constituent sequences aligned to the human genome, with at least half not aligned to insertions or deletions, were considered successfully aligned.

Aggregated DNaseI cleavage profiles
Mouse motif models from TRANSFAC25, version 2011.1, JASPAR Core26, and UniPROBE27 were used in conjunction with the FIMO motif scanning software, version 4.6.1, using a P < 1×10−5 threshold, to find predicted motif instances within hotspot regions as identified by the hotspot algorithm20. All motif instances identified for a given model were padded by 10 bp on each side, and aligned in a strand sensitive manner. DNaseI cleavages were averaged for each aligned nucleotide to create an aggregate profile for the motif model.

De novo motif model discovery and comparison
The method for the identification of de novo motif models using mouse DNaseI footprints was identical to that previously described using human DNaseI footprints10. Across 25 mouse cell types, we identified 604 unique motif models within DNaseI footprints.

We compared de novo motif models to models available as part of various experimentally grounded databases, including TRANSFAC, JASPAR Core, and UniPROBE using the TOMTOM software, version 4.6.128. TOMTOM parameters were set to their default values during model comparisons with the exception of the min-overlap argument, which was set to 5. When partitioning the de novo motifs by assigning each to a single category, the order of match assignment preference was to TRANSFAC, JASPAR Core, UniPROBE and finally to the novel motif category. The novel motif models were further classified using previously published motif models derived from human DNaseI footprinting experiments10. We also determined the proportion of motif models in each experimentally grounded database that matched to mouse de novo motif models using TOMTOM with the same parameter settings.

Analysis of nucleotide diversity (pi)
To quantify the nature of selection operating on regulatory DNA, we surveyed nucleotide diversity (π) in footprint calls. Population genetics analyses were performed as previously described on 53 unrelated, publicly available human genomes released by Complete Genomics, version 1.1029. Relatedness was determined both by pedigree and with KING30. Variant sites were filtered by coverage (>20% of individuals must have calls). Additionally, Complete Genomics makes partial calls at some sites (that is, one allele is A and the other is N). These were counted as fully missing. Repeats were defined by RepeatMasker, downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser (http://www.repeatmasker.org). CpGs and repeats were removed from all footprints before analysis. π for a single variant is 2pq, where p = major allele frequency and q = minor allele frequency. π was calculated for each cell type by summing for all variants and dividing by total number of bases considered. Although binding elements for mouse-selective motif models are enriched in mouse DNaseI footprints, instances of these models in human footprints are also present, but to a significantly lesser degree. To identify instances of mouse-selective motif models in human regulatory elements, human DHSs were scanned using each of the novel mouse-selective motif models and the FIMO software tool (P < 1e-5). Predicted motif instances in human DHSs were then filtered to those that overlapped human DNaseI footprints identified in any human cell type by at least 3 nucleotides.

Calculation of cell-selective motif occupancy
We scanned for instances of a motif model using the FIMO software tool (P < 1e-5) and filtered predicted motif instances to those that overlapped DNaseI footprints identified in a particular cell type by at least 3 nucleotides. To derive a final occupancy value for a motif model in that cell type, we counted the total number of DNaseI footprinted motif instances for that motif model and normalized it by the total number of bases contained within DNaseI footprints in that cell type.

Calculation of promoter-proximal occupancy of motif models
We scanned for instances of a novel mouse-selective motif model using the FIMO software tool (P < 1e-5) and filtered predicted motif instances to those that overlapped DNaseI footprints identified in any cell type by at least 3 nucleotides. We classified those within 5 kb of a transcriptional start site using Refseq annotations as ‘gene-proximal’ and all others as ‘gene-distal’.

TF Regulatory network construction
Transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks were constructed as previously described1 using 5,000 nucleotide buffers anchored on canonical TF transcriptional start site (TSS) annotations. TF genes and motif models used for network construction were collected from the JASPAR Core, UniPROBE and TRANSFAC databases. To create genome-wide networks this method was extended to include all mm9 RefSeq genes, anchored using the 5’-most TSS annotation31.

Clustering and similarities of TF regulatory networks
We computed the pairwise Jaccard distances between TF regulatory networks and applied Ward clustering32 using the hclust and dendrogram functions in R. The heatmap representation in Fig. 3d used the Jaccard index for a similarity measure. Importantly, all comparisons were made using the same subset of orthologous TF genes (567) with known, associated motif models in both species.

TF regulatory edge conservation
To identify conserved regulatory connections that are also sequence conserved we first collected all motif instances that overlapped a DNaseI footprint by at least 3nt in a specific mouse cell type that gave rise to a regulatory edge in that cell-type TF regulatory network. We then aligned the coordinates of this mouse motif instance to the human genome using the “over chain” best pairwise alignment file available from the UCSC Genome Browser. A mouse motif instance was considered successfully aligned if 50% or more of its underlying sequence aligned to the human genome, with at least half not aligned to insertions or deletions. If a mouse motif instance aligned to a motif instance of the same TF in the human genome, and that human motif instance also overlapped a DNaseI footprint by at least 3nt in an orthologous human cell type that gave rise to the same regulatory edge in that orthologous human cell-type TF regulatory network, then that edge in the mouse TF regulatory network was classified as a shared edge arising from an orthologous binding element. Notably, an edge that connects two TFs within a regulatory network may arise from a single, or multiple distinct footprinted TF binding elements. In cases where multiple, distinct footprinted TF binding elements underlie a regulatory edge within a mouse cell-type TF regulatory network, this regulatory edge is considered to arise from an orthologous binding element so long as one of these TF binding elements is a shared connection arising from an orthologous binding element.

We calculated an empirical p-value to evaluate the significance of the number of shared edges found between orthologous mouse and human cell types. We first generated 1000 randomized human TF regulatory networks. When creating a randomized network, we ignored the usual requirement that a motif instance must significantly overlap a human footprint. The genomic space used to construct a random network was identical to that used in the observed case (within 5000 nt of a canonical TSS). A random subset of generated edges was chosen so that the in-degree to every TF gene node was identical to that of the observed human TF regulatory network case (and, hence, the total number of edges was the same), and all edges were unique. We then determined the number of functionally-conserved edges between the observed mouse TF regulatory network and each randomized human TF regulatory network. We counted the number of times this number of functionally-conserved edges was at least as large as in the observed TF regulatory networks case. An empirical p-value was calculated as one more than the number of times this event occurred divided by 1000. This analysis was performed between every pair of orthologous cell types. No randomized experiment gave a functionally-conserved number that reached or exceeded the observed, real TF regulatory networks case.

Network motif architectures
We removed self-edges from every TF regulatory network and used the mfinder software tool for network motif analysis33. A z-score was calculated over each of 13 network motifs of size 3 (three-node network motifs), using 250 randomized networks of the same size for a null estimate. We vectorized z-scores from every cell type and normalized each to unit length to create triad significance profiles18.

Distribution of 3-node network motifs
We enumerated all 3-node circuits in a mouse TF regulatory network, and determined if and how each was connected in an orthologous human cell-type TF regulatory network. Software is available for download at https://github.com/StamLab/network-motifs.

Central-facing versus peripheral-facing TF enrichments
Enrichments were calculated by taking the log base 2 of the ratio of two proportions. The numerator was the proportion of outgoing edges from a TF node in the regulatory network that connected to another TF node, divided by the total number of input edges to all TFs. The denominator was the proportion of outgoing edges from a TF node that connected to any non-TF gene node, divided by the total number of input edges to all non-TFs gene nodes.
