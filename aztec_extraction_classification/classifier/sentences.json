In contrast to Mendelian diseases, however, linkage studies have identified very few reproducibly linked loci in diseases such as diabetes and autism. Users can interactively filter and prioritize variants based on haplotype sharing across selected individuals and other measures of importance, including predicted functional consequence and population frequency. Availability:\nhttp://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/olorin\n\nContact:\nolorin@sanger.ac.uk\n==== Body\n1 INTRODUCTION\nNext generation sequencing has rapidly become the standard approach for identifying mutations responsible for Mendelian diseases (Bamshad et al., 2011). Although software and file formats for the processing of raw sequence data are relatively robust (Danecek et al., 2011; Li et al., 2009), there is currently a lack of easy-to-use software for downstream analysis of these data.",

Although Perl scripts are perfectly suited for processing large volumes of text-based data, Perl is not ideal for developing large-scale software applications nor embedding in graphical interfaces. A single installation of the JEnsembl API can therefore simultaneously and transparently connect to current and previous database instances (such as those in the public archive) thus facilitating better analysis repeatability and allowing \u2018through time\u2019 comparative analyses to be performed. Availability: Project development, released code libraries, Maven repository and documentation are hosted at SourceForge (http://jensembl.sourceforge.net). Contact:\njensembl-develop@lists.sf.net, andy.law@roslin.ed.ac.uk, trevor.paterson@roslin.ed.ac.uk\n==== Body\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe Ensembl Project provides a genome information system for the annotation, analysis and display of genome assembly data pertaining to vertebrates [ENSEMBL (http://www.ensembl.org)] and for other taxonomic groups [ENSEMBLGENOMES (http://www.ensemblgenomes.org)]. Together with core genomic annotations, the curated resources now include comparative genomic, variation, functional genomic and regulatory data stored in separate but linked database schemas (Flicek et al., 2010). Access to data in Ensembl databases is freely provided through Ensembl\u2019s interactive web browser, the BioMart data mining tool (http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview) and web services (http://www.biomart.org/martservice.html), publicly exposed MySQL databases (ensembldb.ensembl.org:5306; mysql.ebi.ac.uk:4157; ensembldb.ensembl.org:3306) and programmatically through Perl API modules (http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/api.html) (Stabenau et al., 2004). The Perl API is ideally suited to the processing of large volumes of text-based data and as such is used for the majority of the Ensembl systems\u2019 internal workflows. Typically, these APIs do not directly address the issue of schema versioning, and many are not actively maintained. Two of the most widely used such APIs are the Bioconductor R interface to BioMart, \u2018biomaRt\u2019 (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biomaRt.html), although this is a biomart API rather than an Ensembl API per se, and the BioGem plug-in \u2018ruby-ensembl-api\u2019 (http://bioruby-annex.rubyforge.org/) which uses Active Records to abstract over the Ensembl Core Schema. Although the ActiveRecord design allows the API code to remain \u2018in sync\u2019 with the database schema automatically, no higher level data model is generated and scripts that run against a particular release of the Ensembl databases will not run against other releases if the names of tables or columns have been changed. Several Python-based APIs that have been made available have not evolved with schema changes and provide limited data models [e.g. PyCogent (http://pycogent.sourceforge.net) (Knight et al., 2007), PyGr (http://code.google.com/p/pygr/wiki/PygrOnEnsembl), cache-ensembl (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cache_ensembl)]. A new, easily maintainable Java-based API to the Ensembl system would be a timely and highly effective addition to the bioinformatics toolbox. Such an API would allow integration between graphical user interfaces and Ensembl datasources and between other bioinformatic resources and libraries implemented in Java [for example, the BioJava (http://www.biojava.org) framework; Holland et al., 2008]. A full Java API to the Ensembl system would replicate all the data access functionality of the Perl API Core, Compara, FuncGen and Variation modules and would:\nConnect to and extract data from the current release version of Ensembl. We have also implemented retrieval of SNP variation information from the \u2018Variation\u2019 databases and comparative homology information from the \u2018Compara\u2019 databases. We demonstrate the potential utility of our Ensembl Java API by incorporating the JEnsembl libraries in a plug-in created for the Savant Genome Browser (http://www.savantbrowser.com/) (Fiume et al., 2010), and in our Genetic Map Drawing application \u2018ArkMAP\u2019 (http://www.thearkdb.org/arkdb/download.jsp). These plug-ins demonstrate how third-party developers can use JEnsembl to access data from Ensembl datasources, allowing the graphical display and alignment of chromosomal sequences, variations and exceptions, gene annotations and gene homologies. 2 IMPLEMENTATION\nJEnsembl is implemented in Java version 1.6 following a modular design pattern using Maven software management. Project development is hosted on SourceForge where code is available from the subversion repository (http://jensembl.sourceforge.net/; https://sourceforge.net/projects/jensembl/). The architecture of the project is shown schematically in Figure 1. These data objects are created and populated through the data access layer (see Fig. 1) using MyBatis (http://www.mybatis.org/) as the RDBMS-to-Java object-mapping tool. A fundamental goal of the project design was to separate schema version-specific database query code from the data model; this is achieved by partitioning the SQL code and MyBatis data mapping rules into a hierarchy of XML configuration files in the configuration module (see Fig. The JEnsembl release libraries were used to create a novel plug-in for the Savant Genome Browser (Fiume et al., 2011). The plug-in source code and binary Jars for different versions of the browser are also available from the JEnsembl project site on SourceForge (http://jensembl.sourceforge.net/savant.html). Our \u2018ArkMAP\u2019 map drawing tool has recently been converted to retrieve chromosome gene annotation data directly from Ensembl datasources using the JEnsembl API instead of the BioMart web services, thus allowing ArkMAP to be \u2018Version Aware\u2019 for Ensembl data.",

Reads derived from known microorganisms can easily be identified and analyzed using fast homology search algorithms and a suitable reference database, but the unknown sequences are often ignored in further analyses, biasing conclusions. Results: Here, we introduce crAss, a novel bioinformatic tool that enables fast simple analysis of cross-assembly files, yielding distances between all metagenomic sample pairs and an insightful image displaying the similarities. Availability and implementation: crAss is available as a web server at http://edwards.sdsu.edu/crass/, and the Perl source code can be downloaded to run as a stand-alone command line tool. Contact:\ndutilh@cmbi.ru.nl\n\nSupplementary information:\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. We note that the user can strip the potentially privacy-sensitive sequence information from these files before uploading, as is explained on the crAss help page. Examples of input files for crAss analysis, including a simplified toy example, are available through the crAss web site (http://edwards.sdsu.edu/crass). For every contig, crAss counts the number of reads derived from each metagenome and determines whether the contig is shared between two or more samples (cross-contig). Table 1 shows the 15 samples from these publications that we used as test data for crAss. All reads were preprocessed using a pipeline including cross_match (http://www.phrap.org/) to remove possible vector contamination, TagCleaner (Schmieder et al., 2010) to remove sequencing tags, PRINSEQ (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011b) to filter low quality, short and duplicate sequences and DeconSeq (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011a) to remove human-like sequence contamination. The details of the preprocessing pipeline are available at http://edwards.sdsu.edu/mymgdb/. We then combined the 15 datasets into a single cross-assembly using gsAssembler 2.6 (Margulies et al., 2005) with default parameters. A triangle plot of the same data is also available. These graphs can be retrieved at http://edwards.sdsu.edu/crass/ under Job ID 1329506771\n\n\n\nMore than three metagenomes cannot be easily visualized in such a plot, so when more than three datasets are used, crAss outputs a cladogram that shows the similarities between samples. The cladogram is calculated from the distance matrix using BioNJ (Gascuel, 1997), and crAss outputs a different one for each of the four distance formulas. This cladogram was based on Equation (1). The complete output for this dataset, including distance matrices and cladograms based on the other distance formulas, can be retrieved at http://edwards.sdsu.edu/crass/ under Job ID 1329505996\n\n\n\n4 DISCUSSION\nDetermining the interrelationships between metagenomes from different biomes or different time points is important to understand the microbial world around us. Mapping metagenomic sequences to a reference database of known genes is a feasible approach to transfer taxonomical and functional annotations to sequence reads.",

The use of these resources is impaired by the sheer size of the available big data and big metadata. Conclusion\nCroCo adds an intuitive unifying view on the data from the ENCODE projects via a comprehensive repository of derived context-specific regulatory networks and enables flexible cross-context, cross-species, and cross-compendia comparison via a basis set of analysis tools. The CroCo web-application and Cytoscape plug-in are freely available at: http://services.bio.ifi.lmu.de/croco-web. The web-page links to a detailed system description, a user guide, and tutorial videos presenting common use cases of the CroCo framework. Finally, CroCo features the data cube paradigm characterized by: (i) the convenient multidimensional navigation in any order of the dimensions, (ii) the ontology-supported browsing of the data cube dimensions, (iii) combination, and (iv) comparison of networks, including cross-species transfer of regulatory network models.

Fundamental cellular based studies as well as modeling provides insight into cancer biology and strategies to treatment of the disease. Within this paper we present the implementation of the Cellular Potts Model graphically presented through Cytoscape.js within a Web application. The tool is available under the MIT license at https://github.com/davcem/cpm-cytoscapeand http://styx.cgv.tugraz.at:8080/cpm-cytoscape/. Conclusion\nIn-silico methods overcome the lack of wet experimental possibilities and as dry method succeed in terms of reduction, refinement and replacement of animal experimentation, also known as the 3R principles. We use Cytoscape.js to plot the lattice-based graph visualization as well as Flot, a Jquery.js extension, to draw simple line charts. Usage of cpm-cytoscape\nBased on a study on a brain cancer type modelled by CPM [51] and our ongoing work on tumor growth profiles for simulation [74] we introduce the tool through a short tutorial at https://github.com/davcem/cpm-cytoscape. We encourage readers to use GitHub for having a closer look at our implementation, explore its features and suggest enhancements as well as participate in the development. The tool developed and used for the simulations has been published in the GitHub repository, saved as cpm-cytoscape. It can be obtained via the url address: https://github.com/davcem/cpm-cytoscape. Further, we provide a demo version that is online available on: http://styx.cgv.tugraz.at:8080/cpm-cytoscape/. We created the tool to allow for easy manipulation by its user. 4. Application example of cpm-cytoscape\nWe created a step-by-step tutorial on the presented tool using a tumor growth example based on parameters from a study on a brain cancer type modelled by CPM [51], available under https://github.com/davcem/cpm-cytoscape [74]. This example results in cellular growth of dark cells, representing tumor cells, showing a trend similar to Gompertz law.

This ubiquitin-conjugation process typically binds the last amino acid of ubiquitin (glycine 76) to a lysine residue of a target protein. Conclusion\nThe independent testing result indicated the effectiveness of incorporating MDDLogo-identified motifs into the prediction of ubiquitylation sites. In order to provide meaningful assistance to researchers interested in large-scale ubiquitinome data, the two-layered SVM model has been implemented onto a web-based system (UbiSite), which is freely available at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/UbiSite/. Two cases given in the UbiSite provide a demonstration of effective identification of ubiquitylation sites with reference to substrate motifs.

In the last years, different mathematical models based on ordinary differential equations have been proposed in the literature to describe specific features of the ISP, thus providing a description of the behaviour of the system and its emerging properties.

Such reconstructions are biochemically, genetically, and genomically structured knowledge bases that can be converted into a mathematical format to enable a myriad of computational biological studies. We show the utility of integrating molecular scale analyses with systems biology approaches by discussing several comparative analyses on the temperature dependence of growth, the distribution of protein fold families, substrate specificity, and characteristic features of whole cell proteomes. Finally, to aid in the grand challenge of big data to knowledge, we provide several explicit tutorials of how protein-related information can be linked to genome-scale models in a public GitHub repository (https://github.com/SBRG/GEMPro/tree/master/GEMPro_recon/).

Such network reconstructions are biochemically, genetically, and genomically (BiGG) structured knowledge bases [5] that can be used for discovery purposes (such as model-driven discovery of unidentified metabolic reactions [6], studies of evolutionary processes [7], and analysis of biological network properties), as well as practical applications (such as metabolic engineering, prediction of cellular phenotypes [8], and interspecies similarities and differences).

Previous studies have been able to explore disease similarity, i.e., disease relationship, from clinical manifestations [2\u20136], electronic medical records [7\u201310], disease-related genes [1, 11], miRNA [12], proteins [13] or pathways [14], chemical fragments [15], microbiota [16], disease-related metabolic reactions [17], disease-related differentially expressed genes [18\u201320] and multi-types of data [9, 19, 21]. All the involved GSEs, genes, pathways or drugs can be linked to their original databases, and all data in DNetDB can be downloaded as well. Construction\nGene expression dataset\nWe obtained 954 GSE datasets using a unique platform, GPL96, from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) [32] during the period from 2003 to 2013. By setting the following three rules: 1) more than five samples in health condition and disease condition respectively 2) samples coming from fresh organs (excluding cell lines) 3) samples in health condition and disease condition coming from the same organs or cells, 106 GSEs were remained. By using a differential coexpression analysis method previously developed in our DCGL v2 R package [26\u201329], we identified 1,326 disease relationships among 108 diseases based on gene expression data [30]. The 1,326 disease relationships and their relevant information were collected in the human disease network database (DNetDB), which can be visited at http://app.scbit.org/DNetDB/#. The database provides abundant information including not only disease definition, six types of IDs for disease (including disease IDs in DO, MeSH, ICD10, ICD9, OMIM and NCIt), GSE IDs, samples size (the number of disease samples the health samples), but also common DCGs, pathways, DRGs, disease-related genes and drugs for each disease pair, as well as graphical display of disease relationships. DNetDB facilitates the study of disease relationships and provides insightful clues to investigate diseases\u2019 etiology and pathogenesis, perform drug repositioning, and design novel therapeutic interventions.

Availability:\nhttp://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/cromwell.html\n\nmass spectrometryMALDISELDIsimulationpeak capacitypeak quantificationmass resolutionisotope distribution\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nMass spectrometry is actively being used to discover disease-related proteomic patterns in complex mixtures of proteins derived from tissue samples or from easily obtained biological fluids such as serum, urine, or nipple aspirate fluid (Paweletz et al., 2000; Paweletz et al., 2001; Wellmann et al., 2002; Petricoin et al., 2002; Adam et al., 2002; Adam et al., 2003; Zhukov et al., 2003; Schaub et al., 2004). These proteomic patterns can potentially be used for early diagnosis, to predict prognosis, to monitor disease progression or response to treatment, or even to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from particular treatments. We expect the simulation to be a useful tool in developing improved methods for processing and analyzing mass spectrometry data, since it will allow us to generate complex spectra where the true locations and sizes of the peaks are known. The simulation code in S-Plus is available from our web site (http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/cromwell.html). Some recent analyses of SELDI spectra have used every measured time point (or every m/z value) as a potential feature used to build a classifier to distinguish cancer samples from normal samples (Petricoin et al., 2002; Zhu et al, 2003).",

The analysis of expression and CGH arrays plays a central role in the study of complex diseases, especially cancer, including finding markers for early diagnosis and prognosis, choosing an optimal therapy, or increasing our understanding of cancer development and metastasis. Asterias (http://www.asterias.info) is an integrated collection of freely-accessible web tools for the analysis of gene expression and aCGH data. Most of the tools use parallel computing (via MPI) and run on a server with 60 CPUs for computation; compared to a desktop or server-based but not parallelized application, parallelization provides speed ups of factors up to 50. The database server for IDconverter and IDClight is MySQL. All applications (except preP, DNMAD and Tnasas) are parallelized using the LAM/MPI implementation (http://www.lam-mpi.org) of MPI. Pomelo II is parallelized in C++, whereas the rest of the applications are parallelized in R using the library Rmpi (http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/yu/Rmpi), and snow (http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/R/cluster/cluster.html) or papply (http://cran.rproject.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/papply.html). The MPI universe is created new for each run of each application, and the actual nodes to use in the MPI universe are determined at run-time after excluding possible non-responding nodes. JavaScript is used for some of the dynamic output (collapsible trees, some clickable figures, and Ajax). Further details about design, implementation, and software and hardware organization, of interest mainly to developers, are provided at the Asterias project\u2019s page (http://bioinformatics.org/asterias/wiki/Main/DevelopersDocumentation). As many other popular tools, we make extensive use of R and BioConductor packages, but many functions have been rewritten to allow for parallel computing. 2006) is an integral part of the development of Asterias. For most applications, a suite of tests, which use the FunkLoad tool (http://funkload.nuxeo.org/), is available from the the Asterias download page (http://bioinformatics.org/asterias/wiki/Main/DownloadPage) or from Launchpad (https://launchpad.net/projects/asterias). By using these tests we verify CGIs (including JavaScript), numerical output, the handling of error conditions and incorrectly formatted input files, and the setting up of MPI universes. For Pomelo II (currently the application that uses the most JavaScript and Ajax) we have also built tests (available from http://pomelo2.bioinfo.cnio.es/tests.html), using Selenium (http://www.openqa.org/selenium/), that verify that the application runs correctly under different operating systems and browsers. Users, application maturity, and bug-tracking\nAsterias is a mature application suite, with a large number of users. only runs with validly formatted data sets are counted). Asterias now includes a bug-tracking and feature-requests page at http://bioinformatics.org/bugs/?group_id=630. User Interface\nInput\nAll applications use plain text files, with tab-separated columns for input. IDClight is designed for automated, programmable access, and accepts \u201cdata entries\u201d via URL (see example in Table 1). DNMAD accepts either files in GPR format (http://www.moleculardevices.com/pages/software/gn_genepix_file_formats.html#gpr) as produced directly by many microarray scanners, or non-GPR files, if they have a specified set of columns (see DNMAD help). The analysis applications need additional files: class information (e.g. Documentation and help\nAll applications have online help, most of them also include tutorials, detailed and commented examples, and sample data files, and Pomelo II also has additional tutorials as flash movies. Tutorials and examples are licensed under a Creative Commons license (http://www.creativecommons.org), thus allowing for redistribution and classroom use. In addition, courses on the use of our tools are taught occasionally. Future work\nOur biggest development efforts are currently focused on two areas. We want to make Asterias easy to deploy at other places; to accomplish this, we are making available all of the source code as soon as it is ready for distribution (right now, all the testing code and some application\u2019s code is available from http://bioinformatics.org/asterias/wiki/Main/DownloadPage or https://launchpad.net/projects/asterias), and we are using a general purpose web framework (Pylons: http://pylonshq.com) to ease distribution and installation. Releasing all of the code and making installation straightforward might draw other developers into Asterias.",

For commercial re-use, please contact journals.permissions@oup.com.Motivation: The computational search for novel microRNA (miRNA) precursors often involves some sort of structural analysis with the aim of identifying which type of structures are prone to being recognized and processed by the cellular miRNA-maturation machinery. Additionally, we show that our approach allows for a better interpretation of the results. Availability and Implementation: The MinDist method is implemented using Perl scripts and is freely available at http://www.cravela.org/?mindist=1. Contact:\nbackofen@informatik.uni-freiburg.de\n\nSupplementary information:\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. Previously, we proposed a combination of measures that distinguishes true pre-miRNAs from the large number of stem-loops that can be found in metazoan genomes (Mendes et al., 2010). However, the number of precursor candidates (in the order of a few hundred thousand) obtained above the optimal cutoff of the score, which combines measures of stability and robustness, is still impractically large to be subjected to experimental confirmation (see the CRAVELA framework website for further details: http:///www.cravela.org). Despite the fact that all these candidates consist of or contain stem-loops, the details of their secondary structure have not been subjected to a thorough analysis. Therefore, we need to define a reasonable partitioning of the cluster tree into an optimal number of clusters. For this purpose, we apply a variant of the Duda rule (Duda et al., 2001) implemented in the tool RNAsoup (http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/\u223ckristin/Software/RNAsoup/). To this purpose, a subtree is reported as an optimal cluster if the sum-of-squared errors for two clusters is not significantly smaller than what is expected by chance (Kaczkowski et al., 2009).",

Implementation\naCGHViewer is implemented as a user-friendly, standalone Java application. It incorporates JFreeChart as the graphing library and only requires the full Java Development Toolkit (version 1.5 or above; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp) to execute the program. JFreeChart is an open source Java library and is available at http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/index.php. aCGH-Viewer has been tested on Windows XP and 2000, Macintosh OS 10.3.9, and Redhat Linux 9. 2b) which is helpful if the user needs to confirm that the same target or cytoband is being identified in multiple samples. Selecting a data point launches the genome browser served at UCSC (http://genome.uscs.edu) or NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with the associated target ID as the query term. The user can then peruse the resulting web page (Fig. We have emphasized the use of this tool to analyze aCGH data but it can be extended to analyze expression data or any other types of data which can be converted to associate with a genome position. aCGHViewer is available for the Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms from http://falcon.roswellpark.org/aCGHview/ under the LGPL license. We welcome bug reports and suggestions for improvement or new features from users.",

Microarray gene expression profiling has been used to distinguish histological subtypes of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and consequently to identify specific tumor markers. Identifying single gene biomarkers by exhaustive search\nHere we identify single genes that correctly classify every sample, by direct comparison of differential expression in every tumor-normal pair (92 comparisons per gene \u00d7 20,192 genes). A gene whose level of expression in every normal sample is always either greater or less than its level in every tumor sample, is ranked according to the smallest expression level distance across the two categories (Perl script is available at http://visant.bu.edu/skirca/script.pl). The smallest separation for a down (up)-regulated gene is the difference between the maximum (minimum) expression level in the tumor samples, and the minimum (maximum) expression level in the normal samples. Twelve of the genes were previously identified by Lenburg et al., two genes by four or more other RCC studies as well. HUGO (The Human Genome Organization) gene symbol (http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/) is used to represent the genes in Table 2 and throughout the paper. Of the 20 genes, 7 had not been previously identified as RCC related, of those 5 are identified by both methods, and 2 of the five are implicated in other cancers.

However, global analysis of these events is currently limited. Node inactivation and node activation would fall within the categories of what is traditionally referred to as loss-of-function and gain-of-function hypermorphic mutations, while the other mutations would fit best within a gain-of-function neomorphic classification. The ReKINect Methodology\nWith the aim of systematically identifying NAMs in phosphorylation-based signaling networks, we developed a computational approach, ReKINect, capable of predicting these defined functional mutations (Figures 1A and 1B; http://ReKINect.science). We began by assembling comprehensive sequence and positional information covering all known 538 kinase domains, 111 SH2 domains, and 149,838 phosphorylation sites in the human proteome (refer to the Experimental Procedures for further information). is currently funded by a Ludwig Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship.

Genome sequencing in viral outbreaks is desirable in order to characterize the infectious agent to determine its evolutionary rate, signatures of host adaptation, identification and monitoring of diagnostic targets and responses to vaccines and treatments. By integrating our dataset, in real time, with that of a second group performing sequencing in Sierra Leone we identified evidence of frequent transmissions across the border with Guinea. Crucially, we released data at regular intervals throughout this project through Github, integrating our results with that of others and interactively displayed at http://ebola.nextflu.org. We employed the Virological web forum to discuss complex cases (http://virological.org). This system will continue to support the West African epidemic response and will serve as a template for genomic surveillance of future outbreaks. Samples with TPR <75% were not used for the phylogenetic analysis presented here. Signal-based SNP calling\nSNPs were called using the \u201cvariants\u201d module from the nanopolish package (manuscript in preparation, https://github.com/jts/nanopolish, branch snp_calling_alternative_models, commit ID 25ea7bac3ab9e1d266079ac105ab2005cfa39a14). The nanopolish variants program first finds candidate SNPs by finding mismatches between the aligned nanopore reads and the reference genome. After sorting and converting the resulting alignment to BAM using samtools, variants were determined using FreeBayes 23. A consensus sequence was generated using the vcf2fasta component of vcflib (https://github.com/ekg/vcflib). The MinION data was analysed as per the study methods, except for a modification to nanopolish to allow it to consider up to 15 variants per segment in order to account for the increased divergence between the genome and the reference. A phylogeny was inferred using RaXML 25 including the consensus sequences from the validation set along with all of the consensus sequences from Carroll et al. MinION sequence accuracy rates for two-direction (2D) reads were determined using Aaron Quinlan\u2019s count-errors.py script (http://github.com/arq5x/nanopore-scripts) as described in Quick et al. 11. Each pair was compared individually using the show-snps module of MUMmer to investigate differences. Detection of putative transmission events from Sierra Leone\nWe downloaded the 74 genome sequences made available on Virological.org (http://virological.org/t/direct-deep-sequencing-in-sierra-leone-yields-73-new-ebovgenomes-from-february-may-2015/134 and aligned them against sequences from our analysis using MUSCLE 26. We then generated a phylogenet ) ic tree using FastTree 2 with the GTR model 27. Maximum-likelihood trees are produced using RAxML 8.2.3 using the GTRGAMMA model and 200 bootstrap replicates 25. Time-scaled trees were produced with BEAST v1.8.2 28using a HKY+gamma substitution model 29,30 partitioned by first, second and third codon positions and intergenic regions, a Skygrid tree prior 31 and an uncorrelated lognormal clock 32, and an uninformative prior on the mean of the molecular clock rate (XML file available at https://github.com/nickloman/ebov). The maximum clade credibility tree was recovered using TreeAnnotator. Phylogenetic trees were annotated using the ete3 Python package.

MetMap is free, open source software, and can be downloaded from the following site:\n\n\nhttp://www.cs.berkeley.edu/meromit/MetMap.html\n\n\nEvaluating Per-Site Coverage and Span of Methods for Methyltyping\nIn the Methylseq experiment, information regarding the methylation state of a CCGG site can be obtained for the subset of CCGGs that are present on some fragment that has CCGG sites at its ends and that passes the size selection step (see \u201cCG sites in the scope of the MethylSeq experiment\u201d section for details). We computed the number of CCGGs of the human genome that fulfill this criterion to be 1,349,378. Each SUMI receives a score, specifying the mean of the MetMap scores at all of the sites within the SUMI. The SUMI lists for the four human neutrophil samples can be found at:\n\n\nhttp://www.cs.berkeley.edu/meromit/SUMIs_Human_Neutrophil/\n\n\nValidation with Bisulfite Sequencing\nDNA was treated with the MethylEasy bisulfite conversion kit (Human Genetic Signatures), PCR-amplified with locus-specific primers that recognized human target sequences, and sequenced using standard Sanger chemistry. Since all epialleles from a single specimen were sequenced in bulk in the same mixture, we estimated the ratio of unmethylated/methylated alleles at each CG in the sequence by examining the relative heights of the \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018T\u2019 traces in the sequencing output.",

Download site: http://www.lgm.upmc.fr/CCDMintseris/\n\nAuthor Summary\nProtein-protein interactions (PPI) are at the heart of the molecular processes governing life and constitute an increasingly important target for drug design. Given their importance, it is vital to determine which protein interactions have functional relevance and to characterize the protein competition inherent to crowded environments, as the cytoplasm or the cellular organelles. For example, 1AY7_r and 1AY7_l refer to barnase (receptor) and barstar (ligand) in the barnase-barstar complex 1AY7. The coordinates for the bound and unbound structures of both receptor and ligand proteins are available in the PDB and can be found at http://zlab.bu.edu/zdock/benchmark.shtml. The docking algorithm\nMolecular docking is performed with the MAXDo (Molecular Association via Cross Docking) algorithm, developed for complete cross-docking (CC-D) studies [12]. More technical details regarding the execution of the program on WCG can be found in [52]. The data analysis was partly realized on Grid'5000 (https://www.grid5000.fr). Definition of surface and interface residues\nSurface residues are residues with at least  of accessible surface.

In response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions. Availability:\nhttp://cd-hit.org. Contact:\nliwz@sdsc.edu\n\nSupplementary information:\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. The improved alignment band estimation can find a narrower band for banded alignment. 2.4 Implementation\nThis enhanced CD-HIT is implemented in the C++ programming language and uses OpenMP (http://www.openmp.org) for parallelization.

The data include 102 Affymetrix U95Av2 GeneChips from 50 healthy prostate samples and 52 prostate tumor samples, consisting of 12,625 probe sets representing 7,865 distinct UniGene clusters (UniGene Build 170). It is available at the Center for Genome Research, Whitehead Institute (http://www.broad.mit.edu/cgi-bin/cancer/datas-ets.cgi). The Stanford, two-color fluorescent cDNA microarray data were obtained through a study identifying clinically relevant subtypes of prostate cancer (Lapointe et al. A common reference material, pooled from 11 established human cell lines, was labeled with Cy3. The raw micro-array data can be downloaded from the Stanford Microarray Database (http://cmgm.stanford.edu/pbrown/). Prostate cancer prognostic indices\nProstate tumor prognosis is indicated by the Gleason score, ranging from 2 to 10, which is based on the architectural pattern of the prostate tumor, and indicates its aggressiveness (Gleason and Mellinger, 1974; Gleason, 1977). Because GenBank numbers identify sequences rather than genes, we replaced them with identifiers linked to the concept of an individual gene: UniGene cluster identifiers. To update the gene annotations to a recent UniGene build (Build 170, July 2004), we used in-house software, GeneLink, which is freely available online (http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/GeneLink/). We then combined the array data from genes that were common to both platforms, and obtained a data set consisting of the standardized measurements of 6402 genes from 114 patients with prostate cancer.",

In this review, we take a survey of bioinformatics databases and quantitative structure-activity relationship studies reported in published literature. The cancer research community has not remained indifferent to the importance of databases. From the big organizations such as National Cancer Institute (NCI; http://www.cancer.gov) to smaller research groups, scientists have developed databases relating to the genetics, molecular biology, microarray clinical reports and several other aspects of cancer. Table 2 lists some of the most prominent databases, which have emerged in respect of cancer research. Some of these databases are discussed below:\n\nCancer Chromosomes database\n(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=cancerchromosomes) Cancer Chromosomes integrates data from three sources: the NCI/NCBI SKY/M-FISH & CGH Database, the NCI Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer, and the NCI Recurrent Aberrations in Cancer (Knutsen et al. 2005). Similarity reports demonstrating cytogenetic and clinical relatedness at varying levels of specificity are also returned on querying this database. CGED (Cancer Gene Expression Database)\n(http://cged.hgc.jp/cgi-bin/input.cgi) CGED is a database containing expression profiles and accompanying clinical information of breast, colorectal, and hepatocellular cancer related genes (Kato et al. The sorting function enables users for easy recognition of relationships between gene expression and clinical parameters. The Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology\n(http://www.infobiogen.fr/services/chromcancer) The Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology is a database containing information about genes related to cancer (Huret et al. 2000). This database also referred to as The Atlas is part of the genome project and participates in the research in cancer epidemiology. Database of germline p53 mutations\n(http://www.lf2.cuni.cz/projects/germline_mut_p53.htm) Somatic mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are found in many human cancers (Le Roux et al. Each entry contains the original research article as reference(s). COSMIC database\n(http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/) COSMIC is a database designed to store and display somatic mutation information-relevant for cancer (Forbes et al. 2006). The data can be queried by tissue, histology or gene and displayed as a graph, as a table or exported to other formats. EHCO database\n(http://ehco.nchc.org.tw) EHCO (Encyclopedia of Hepatocellular Carcinoma genes Online) is an integrative database for HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) research. It carries gene annotations collected by computer-assisted mining, manual curation, and extraction from public databases. Detailed annotations for particular genes, including sequence, ontology, cited literature, and expression profiles are also available. Human p53 database\n(http://metalab.unc.edu/dnam/mainpage.html) A collection of databases relating to p53 gene mutations, lacI and lacZ is available on this website (Cariello et al. 1994; Cariello et al. Information specific to the p53 database includes cancer type, cell origin, loss of heterozygosity. IARC TP53 Database\n(http://www.p53.iarc.fr/index.html) The IARC TP53 Database compiles data on human somatic and germline TP53 genetic variations that are reported in the published literature.

Online service also allows some basic statistical analysis of the database such as the comparison of expression distribution profiles, tests for differential expression, and patient survival analyses. The Mouse Tumor Biology Database (MTB)\n(http://www.informatics.jax.org) MTB database compiles and shares information about tumor frequency, genetics, and pathology in genetically denned mice (i.e., transgenics, targeted mutations, and inbred strains) (Bult et al. 2001). Existing standards for anatomy, tumor names, gene names, and strain names are well enforced, enabling direct links to information across MTB entries and to other relevant databases. The Tumor Gene Family Databases (TGDBs)\n(http://condor.bcm.tmc.edu/ermb/tgdb/tgdf.html) TGDB is made up of two databases viz. Oral Cancer Gene Database (OrCGDB) and Breast Cancer Gene Database (BCGD).

Sound data analysis is critical to the success of modern molecular medicine research that involves collection and interpretation of mass-throughput data. Thus Machine Learning and Statistical approaches are quite often synergistic for attacking hard modeling and discovery data analysis problems. An accessible and extensive on-line tutorial on Machine Learning methods and biomedical case studies is available from http://www.dsl-lab.org. Some excellent introductory texts are [Mitchell, 1997], [Hastie, 2001], [Duda, 2001], and [Weiss, 1991]. While it is certainly too early to conclude with certainty which existing or yet-to-be-discovered causal inference algorithms will prove to be most effective for mass-throughput data, it is safe to say that formal theories of causal inference, well-characterized algorithmic frameworks and resulting practical algorithms for computational causal discovery will play a significant role in deciphering mechanistic and structural aspects of mass-throughput data as opposed to strictly associational and predictive methods (for example, see a comprehensive bibliography on learning causal networks of gene interactions via formalized causal as well as heuristic regulatory induction algorithms [Markowetz, 2005]). As emerging examples of formal computational causal discovery tools, we cite the Causal Explorer toolkit (http://www.dsl-lab.org) or the Tetrad IV (http://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/tetrad/). 3.6.",

Summary\nIn our previous study [1], we have compared the performance of a number of widely used discrimination methods for classifying ovarian cancer using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry data on serum samples obtained from Reflectron mode. For the ovarian MS dataset that is the focus of the current study, our results show that approximately 20\u201340 m/z features are needed to achieve the best classification accuracy from MALDI-MS analysis of sera. Supplementary information can be found at http://bioinformatics.med.yale.edu/proteomics/BioSupp2.html. ==== Body\nIntroduction\nProteomics is an integral part of the process of understanding biological systems, pursuing drug discovery, and uncovering disease mechanisms. Experimental Data\nWe have obtained ovarian cancer and control serum samples from the National Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Program at Northwestern University Hospital. The Keck Laboratory then subjected these samples to automated desalting and MALDI-MS on a Micromass M@LDI-L/R instrument as described generally at: http://info.med.yale.edu/wmkeck/prochem/biomarker.htm.

The bioinformatics tools and databases including those introduced in this article are available from our web site, http://dragon.bio.purdue.edu/bioinfolinks. Previous Reviews\nRhodes et al proposed a statistical model for performing meta-analysis of gene expression data across independent studies, and applied it to expression profiles of prostate cancer (Rhodes et al 2002). Users can easily perform comparative evaluation of different methods on their data sets. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) (Tusher et al 2001) and NUDGE (Dean and Raftery 2005) use R, which is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics (http://www.r-project.org/). The last website contains abundant links to statistical tools for gene expression analysis using R. A good summary of statistical testing for gene expression was given by Dudoit et al. Unlike the conventional way to use PSI-BLAST, PFP mines more functional information from sequence hits with generally-thought insignificant hits by applying function association rules learned from genes of known function in public databases. PFP performed the best at the automatic function prediction competition held at the 13th Annual International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) in June, 2005 (http://ffas.burnham.org/AFP). Among the servers listed here, BLAST, FASTA and Pfam are the most reliable but may not provide additional functional information to annotation already stored in public databases.",

How and when it originated remains contentious. This alignment was performed using bwa aln (Li and Durbin, 2009) with the seed option disabled for better\u00a0sensitivity for ancient data, enforcing global alignment of the read\u00a0to the reference genome. Each sequencing run was merged to library level and duplicates removed using Picard-1.124 (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/), followed by merging to per sample alignment files. These\u00a0files were filtered for a mapping quality of 30 to only retain high quality alignments and the base qualities were re-scaled for DNA damage\u00a0using MapDamage 2.0 (J\u00f3nsson et\u00a0al., 2013). We note that the absence of KIM pPCP1 is due to it being missing from the reference genome, but that it has been reported to be present in KIM strains (Hu et\u00a0al., 1998). The genotypes were generated as described above and the variant call format (VCF) files from these analyses are available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/suppl/plague/.

Combining single-molecule fluorescence, molecular simulations, and nuclear magnetic resonance, we show that a rapidly fluctuating FG-Nup populates an ensemble of conformations that are prone to bind NTRs with\u00a0near diffusion-limited on rates, as shown by stopped-flow kinetic measurements.

Here, we show that the growth of tumors formed by mutant BrafV600E mouse melanoma cells in an immunocompetent host requires their production of prostaglandin E2, which suppresses immunity and fuels tumor-promoting inflammation. CT26, 4T1, and EL4 cells were from ATCC. Ptgs2\u2212/\u2212, Ptgs1/Ptgs2\u2212/\u2212, and Pges\u2212/\u2212 cells were generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering using the CRISPR design tool provided by the Zhang lab (http://www.genome-engineering.org). Correctly targeted clones were selected based on their inability to produce PGE2, and genetic ablation of COX-1, COX-2, mPGES-1, and mPGES-2 was verified by sequencing. Expression of an array of immune genes was performed using a TaqMan mouse immune array (v.2.1), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Human Microarray Dataset Analysis\nRaw CEL files from the microarray dataset GSE3189 were downloaded from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Statistics\nStatistical significance was determined using an unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t test, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, Fisher\u2019s exact test, log rank test, and the Pearson correlation coefficient as indicated.

Breakdowns in this high-fidelity capability are a driving force in cancer and other diseases. Frobenius Distance between Matrices or Vectors\nAs a measure of dissimilarity between matrices or vectors, the Frobenius distance or norm can be simply calculated as the square root of the difference between every value in the two matrices or vectors squared (Ellis and Kobe, 2011).

Flexibility in the\u00a0nuclear genetic code has been demonstrated in ciliates that reassign standard stop codons to amino acids, resulting in seven variant genetic codes, including three previously undescribed ones reported here. First, we generated a database of peptide sequences by translating nucleotide sequences in all six frames with the standard genetic code, recording standard stop codons as \u201cX\u201d (any amino acid). Next, we used HMMER 3.1b (http://hmmer.org) to search and align the hidden Markov models from the Pfam-A protein domain database (release 27) (Finn et\u00a0al., 2014) against the translated sequences. Using a custom Python script, the alignment outputs were filtered at a conditional e-value threshold <1e-10.

Oncogenic Alterations in Patient Tumors Are Conserved across Cell Lines\nNext, we assessed the extent to which the mutational landscape of cancer cell lines captures that seen in primary tumors. We utilized a panel of 1,001 human cancer cell lines analyzed through WES (n\u00a0= 1,001), copy number (n\u00a0= 996), gene expression (n\u00a0=\u00a0968), and DNA methylation (n\u00a0= 957) (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cell_lines) (Figure\u00a01B) and which we reclassified according to the TCGA tissue labels (Figure\u00a02A; Tables S1A and S1E). Molecular alterations identified in cell lines were filtered using the CFEs identified in the primary tumor samples, providing a set of clinically relevant CFEs for the cell lines (Figure\u00a01C). Here, we have extended previous efforts with the systematic expansion of the pharmacological, genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic characterization of 1,001 human cancer cell lines. These datasets can be investigated through the COSMIC and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Web portal (http://www.cancerrxgene.org). To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest and most extensively characterized panel of cancer cell lines and should enable a broad range of studies linking genotypes with cellular phenotypes. Variant Identification in Tumors\nVariant data from sequencing of 6,815 tumor normal sample pairs derived from 48 different sequencing studies were compiled (Rubio-Perez et\u00a0al., 2015). To\u00a0aid in the analysis, the tumor data were reannotated using a pipeline consistent with the COSMIC database (Vagrent: https://zenodo.org/record/16732#.VbeVY2RViko). Methylation Data\nFor primary tumors, raw data for 6,035 methylation samples, covering 18 tumor types, were downloaded from the TCGA data portal. Statistical Models of Drug Response\nFor each drug an ANOVA model was fitted to correlate drug response with the status of Cancer Functional Events (CFEs), as described in Garnett et\u00a0al. (2012), implemented in GDSCtools (http//gdsctools.readthedocs.io) and detailed in the the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. The downsampling ANOVA simulation studies are detailed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. lab is supported in part with funding from AstraZeneca.

In Diptera the gene content of the X chromosome and the autosomes is well conserved: in Drosophila more than 95% of the genes have remained on the same chromosome arm in the 12 sequenced species (63 Myr of divergence, traversing 400 Myr of evolution)2,4,6, and the same linkage groups are clearly recognizable in mosquito genomes (260 Myr of divergence)3,5,7. But the data in hand already strongly support the conclusion that the gene content of the Drosophila Y is younger than the other chromosomes, and that gene acquisition have had a prominent role in its evolution.

An estimated 70% of mouse genes undergo antisense transcription1, including myosin heavy chain 7 (Myh7) that encodes molecular motor proteins for heart contraction2.

The output revealed that Brg1 core helicase domain are structural homologs of SF2 helicases: Vasa44 (Fruit fly, PDB# 2DB3), Rad5427,45 (Zebrafish PDB# 1Z3I, Sulfolobus solfataricus PDB# 1Z63) and Chd146 (Yeast, PDB# 3MWY). Those proteins together with Brg1 were further employed for multiple sequence alignment with T-Coffee, which is a program allowing combination of the results obtained with several alignment methods (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/tcoffee/).

Log2 fold differences were computed from each of two independent experiments using DEseq2. We estimated false discovery rate using the more conservative chance estimate, \u201cflip-flopped\u201d with the following formula: (number of genes on the \u201cflip-flopped\u201d list /number of genes on the differentially expressed genes). To view RNA-Seq data, our GEO accession number is GSE66345 and is accessible via http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66345. Statistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using commercial software (GraphPad Prism; GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA).",

Chemotherapies such as the topoisomerase II inhibitor (TopoIIi) etoposide effectively reduce disease in a minority of NSCLC patients2,3; therefore, alternative drug targets, including epigenetic enzymes, are under consideration for therapeutic intervention4. Of the 180 probes, 64 were redundant, leading to a list of 116 genes highly co-expressed with EZH2 (SI Table 1). Because these data sets were from various microarray platforms, the gene list was then used to generate a probe list for the 116 genes corresponding to probes on the U133A Affymetrix array using the batch query function on the NetAffx website (http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx). Gene Ontology analysis was performed on the EZH2 co-expression signature with dChip software (http://biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/dchip). Microarray Analysis\nAll array data are publically available on Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and correspond to array files available from GSE482442 for all lines except A549, H522 and PC9, GSE5457 for A549 (2 replicates), GSE572043 for H522 and an additional A549, GSE767044 for an additional H1299, GSE1008945 for PC9 and H1650 and GSE3162546 for an additional PC9. Arrays were chosen based on availability in September 2012. Arrays were analyzed using R/Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/). Raw CEL files from U133A Affymetrix arrays were processed using the robust multiarray average (rma) algorithm47. Using this same method of selecting for highest expressing tumors we could visualize positive correlations between EZH2 and other EZH2 co-expression gene signature members (data not shown). Kaplan-Meier Analysis\nRaw gene expression data from the Director\u2019s Challenge human lung adenocarcinoma samples6 were obtained (https://caintegrator.nci.nih.gov/caintegrator/). Probe intensities from the Affymetrix U133A platform used in these studies were normalized and modeled using dChip software50 (http://biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/dchip). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were implemented after the samples were hierarchically clustered using centroid linkage into two risk groups using the EZH2 co-expression gene signature. The mice were imaged by MRI biweekly to determine the reduction in tumor volume during the respective treatments as described previously in a non-blinded fashion12. The tumor burden volume and quantification were reconstructed on 3D slicer software (http://www.slicer.org). Immunohistochemistry was performed as described with anti-EZH2 (clone D2C9; Cell Signaling) or anti-pEGFR (Y1068; clone D7A5; Cell Signaling) and developed using Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Labs).",

Despite recent reports claiming substantially increased reprogramming efficiencies using genetically modified donor cells12,13 prospectively isolating distinct reprogramming intermediates remains an important goal to decipher reprogramming mechanisms. The following compounds were also added to reprogramming medium on the days indicated in the text: BIO 1211 (Tocris, 4nM), adenosine (Sigma, 20\u00b5M or 2 \u00b5M as indicated), fibronectin (Sigma, 4\u00b5g/ml), AMP-CP [Adenosine 5\u2032-(\u03b1,\u03b2-methylene)diphosphate] (Sigma, 20\u00b5M).

Epigenetics may be defined as the mechanisms that lead to heritable changes in gene function and without affecting the sequence of genome. Dynamic models to construct an integrated genetic and epigenetic cellular network (IGECN) not only provide a quantitative description of the integrated cellular network, but also predict the cellular mechanism of the network in response to various conditions, gene knockouts, treatments with external agents, etc [24]. In this study, we integrated omics data, including NGS [25], mRNA and miRNA expression [26], RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) [27], PPIs [28], transcription regulation interaction [29\u201332], miRNA-target gene association [33\u201337], and gene ontology (GO) data (http://geneontology.org/) to construct a candidate IGECN.

Elevated levels of IGF ligands have been observed in ovarian, breast, and colon cancer, and are associated with poor prognosis and resistance to treatment [2\u20136]. Model analysis focused on the level of pIGF1R as IGF2-induced proliferation of OVCAR5 is dependent on IGF1R kinase activity (Additional file 6, [27]). Analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)\nRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data for ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, and colon adenocarcinoma were obtained from TCGA (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/). To compare the individual and combined effectiveness of IGFBPs and IGF2R at inhibiting pIGF1R, model calculations were performed over a range of IGF2R:IGF1R and IGFBP:IGF1R ratios determined from the ovarian cancer data (one to the mean\u2009+\u2009one SD). All statistical calculations were performed using the software package JMP 4.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

KS is the most common cancer in individuals with AIDS and one of the most common cancers in patients who have immunosuppression [2]. For data analysis, quality Fastq sequences, which were without poly-A, ambiguous nucleotides or a 5\u2032 adapter, yet flanking 6\u201318\u00a0nt of 3\u2032 adapter sequence, had the adapter sequences trimmed and the identical sequences were then collapsed to unique sequences. The resulting unique sequences that did not align to the mRNA database (UCSC genome browsers) but were aligned to known microRNA sequences (miRBase R20; http://www.mirbase.org/) were subjected to further quantification analysis. Sequencing reads were used to obtain a RPM (reads per million mapped reads) [22, 23] value calculated as C/(MN)\u2009\u00d7\u2009109, where C is \u201cread numbers aligned to a given miRNA chromosomal region\u201d, M is \u201cmultiple mapping numbers across all miRNA regions\u201d and N is \u201ctotal read numbers that map to human genome sequence\u201d. The miRNAs detected in RT-qPCR, except miR-1246 and miR-1271-5p, were similar to the ones detected in KSHV-infected HUVECs (Additional file 3). Moreover, we had used up to 3 different kind of tools (TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.org/vert_70/), mirDB (http://mirdb.org/miRDB/index.html) and TargetMiner (http://www.isical.ac.in/~bioinfo_miu/targetminer20.htm)) to analyze the targeted genes of c-Myc and Kaposin B induced/reduced top 5 miRNAs (Table\u00a01). Based on our results, 806 genes were targeted by the up-regulated miRNAs (Additional file 4-A) and 818 genes were targeted by the down-regulated miRNAs (Additional file 4-B), respectively. 3d) and their detailed information, including precursor locus, strand and mature sequence. Based on RNAfold analysis (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi), we demonstrated that these novel miRNAs could fold into hairpin secondary structure, which is another miRNA property (Fig. 3e).

Disease progression starts with any of a diverse set of injuries to arterial epithelial layers, which may take years to develop. However, other structures may be physiologically informative, such as Cn/ker(\u2202n), which would represent forms that sprawl and do not enclose volumes. Materials and methods\nDatasets\nSeven thousand six hundred thirteen subjects were selected from Lebanese patients enrolled as part of a multi center cross-sectional study for the FGENTCARD Consortium (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/fgentcard/) [11] in a cross-sectional study. Patients were recruited from catheterized patients at the Rafic Hariri University Hospital and the Centre Hospitalier du Nord in Lebanon between May 2007 and June 2010. The 538 T2D DNA analyses were performed using Human Omni EXP \u2013 12v1 multi-use. Seven hundred eighty nine thousand SNPs passed QC using PLINK 2 [12], (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2) for data management and quality control, keeping samples with call rate ge 95 %, SNPs call rate \u2265 90 %, MAF ge 1 %. BEAGLE ver 4.0 [13], (http://faculty.washington.edu/browning/beagle/beagle.html) was employed to impute SNPs among inconsistent chip SNP sets. SNPs with more than 2 alleles were removed.

It has been estimated that the microbes in our bodies collectively make up to 100 trillion cells, tenfold the number of human cells [2]. The repeats are divided among 6 superclasses, named A to F, that comprise 24 families and 18 structural motifs. Repeat BLAST to CRISPR database\nUnique repeat consensus sequences were matched against the CRISPR database CRISPRdb [26] (http://crispr.u-psud.fr/crispr/BLAST/CRISPRsBlast.php) using a standard BLAST with an e-value threshold of 0.01, in order to find hits for known repeats in our findings and to access the possibility of new repeat sequences. We added a step to remove the matches that have continuous indels of more than 5 nucleotides at either ends of the query or target sequences. It should be referred that if we analyse both healthy and diabetic individuals separately the results are very similar, meaning that we couldn\u2019t find an obvious distinction between the number of CRISPR cassettes or number of spacers found (Table\u00a02).Table 2 Summary of the results\u2019 comparison between the set of CRISPR cassetes found for type-2 diabetic individuals and healthy individuals\n\n\tMetagenomic dataset group\tType-2 diabetic individuals\tHealthy (non-diabetic) individuals\t\n\tCassettes\t\t\t\nIdentified by PILER-CR\t\t1624\t1545\t\nAverage Length (in bp)\t\t757\t777\t\n\tSpacers\t\t\t\nTotal number\t\t16 949\t17 547\t\n\tRepeats\t\t\t\nAverage size (in bp)\t\t31\t32\t\n\n\nComparing our findings with the ones from Gogleva et al.

Schizophrenia is a syndrome characterized by positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior; negative symptoms such as affective flatterning, alogia, or avolition [26, 30]. Out of 306 samples, 246 are available to the public. The RMA normalized expression data (http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/combined.data.txt) and corresponding clinical data (http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/combined.design.txt) of these 246 samples are available for download on their website and will serve as a starting point in this study. The source of six studies available to the public in Mistry\u2019s dataset is summarized in Table\u00a01. ComBat [12] batch effect adjustment was carried out in R environment. We used ComBat() function included in the \u201csva\u201d package downloaded from BioConductor website (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/sva.html) to perform batch effect correction on the original dataset. Each study is treated as a batch and default parameter setup is used in running the ComBat function.Table 1 Public postmortem microarray datasets used in this study\n\nData set\tBrain region\tControl: Schizophrenia\t\nStanley Bahn [35]\tFrontal BA46\t31(24M7F): 34(25M9F)\t\nStanley AltarC [35]\tFrontal BA46/10\t11(7M4F): 9(8M1F)\t\nMclean Harvard Brain Bank [36]\tPrefrontal Cortex (BA9)\t26(18M8F): 19(13M6F)\t\nMirnics [37]\tPrefrontal Cortex (BA46)\t6(4M2F): 9(5M4F)\t\nMaycox GSE17612 [16]\tAnterior prefrontal cortex (BA10)\t21(12M9F): 26(18M8F)\t\nNarayan GSE21138 [19]\tFrontal (BA46)\t29(24M5F): 25(21M4F)\t\n\n\nDifferential expression analysis of each probe set\nExpression values of each probe set were modeled using a fixed effect linear model approach, where disease status and imbalanced covariates between two groups are treated as fixed effects to be estimated from data. After removal of these probe sets from the initial probe set list, we sorted the remaining probe sets within each sex by q-value and report the top ranked probe sets (q-value\u2009<\u20090.05) as sex-specific differentially expressed genes. Function enrichment of differentially expressed genes\nAll differentially expressed genes, along with their Affymetrix ID numbers were imported into EASE (Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer) in DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery), and were used to identify functionally significant gene classes (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) [10]. This webserver uses statistical methods to map and identify functional gene categories (for example, Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) or BioCarta), which are enriched in the significant gene list compared with their presence on the array.",

The Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication waiver(http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) applies to the data made available in this article, unless otherwise stated.Background\nAuxin is a major phytohormone involved in many developmental processes by controlling gene expression through a network of transcriptional regulators. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the auxin signalling network is made of 52 potentially interacting transcriptional regulators, activating or repressing gene expression. Finally, PAM and JTT outputs being rather similar, we focused on the PAM model, since it seems to be the most common one to date.

Information from protein-protein interaction databases, such as OPHID/I2D ((Brown and Jurisica, 2005); http://ophid.utoronto.ca/i2d), further extends the potential to study and model these pathways under specific stimuli or in different tissues. Figure 3 shows one such visualization in NAViGaTor 1.1 (http://ophid.utoronto.ca/navigator), highlighting only core proteins, and suppressing other details by using alpha-blending. Individual nodes in the graph represent proteins, while edges correspond to known and predicted interactions. Using both human curated and predicted protein interaction networks, the authors confirm the finding that curated data is highly biased towards known and disease-related targets. It would be useful to see how the results change by integrating with the larger human interactome, from curated, predicted, and high-throughput experiments, such as in the Interologous Interaction Database I2D (http://ophid.utoronto.ca/i2d).
