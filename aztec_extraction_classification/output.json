  "abstract": "Protein-coding genes with multiple alternative polyadenylation sites can generate mRNA 3 0 UTR sequences of different lengths, thereby causing the loss or gain of regulatory elements , which can affect stability, localization and translation efficiency. 3USS is a web-server developed with the aim of giving experimentalists the possibility to automatically identify alternative 3 0 UTRs (shorter or longer with respect to a reference transcriptome), an option that is not available in standard RNA-seq data analysis procedures. The tool reports as putative novel the 3 0 UTRs not annotated in available databases. Furthermore, if data from two related samples are uploaded, common and specific alternative 3 0 UTRs are identified and reported by the server.", 
  "summary": "The alternative 30UTRs are then compared with already annotated ones in other databases [the latest available data from iGenomes (http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/igenomes.html) and Gencode (Harrow et al., 2012)] to identify putative novel (not yet annotated) 30UTRs. The most informative output files that the 3USS server produces are: a fasta file with the alternative 30UTR nucleotide sequences and other information in their headers (gene Id, coding strand, 30UTR genomic coordinates and length); a list of the transcripts with their 30UTR length difference and a list of the alternative not yet annotated 30UTRs (putative novel) in other databases as well as the annotated ones.",

  "abstract": "Motivation: The 3-dimensional structure of the genome plays a critical role in regulating gene expression. Recent progress in mapping technologies for chromatin interactions has led to a rapid increase in this kind of interaction data. This trend will continue as research in this burgeoning field intensifies. Results: We describe the 4DGenome database that stores chroma-tin interaction data compiled through comprehensive literature cura-tion. The database currently covers both low and high throughput assays, including 3C, 4C-Seq, 5C, Hi-C, ChIA-PET, and Capture-C. To complement the set of interactions detected by experimental assays, we also include interactions predicted by a recently developed computational method with demonstrated high accuracy. The database currently contains ~8 million records, covering 102 cell/tissue types in 5 organisms. Records in the database are described using a standardized file format, facilitating data exchange. The vast major of the interactions were assigned a confidence score. Using the web interface, users can query and download database records via a number of annotation dimensions. Query results can be visualized along with other genomics datasets via links to the UCSC genome browser. We anticipate that 4DGenome will be a valuable resource for investigating the spatial structure-and-function relationship of genomes. Availability and Implementation: 4Dgenome is freely accessible at http://4dgenome.int-med.uiowa.edu. The database and web interface are implemented in MySQL, Apache and JavaScript with all major browsers supported.",

  "abstract": "Motivation: Population trees represent past population divergence histories. The inference of population trees can be useful for the study of population evolution. With the size of data increases in large-scale population genetic projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, there are new computational challenges for ancestral population inference, including population tree inference. Existing methods for population tree inference are mainly designed for unlinked genetic variants (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs). There is a potential loss of information by not considering the haplotypes. Results: In this article, we propose a new population tree inference method (called STELLS H) based on coalescent likelihood. The likelihood is for haplotypes over multiple SNPs within a non-recom-bining region, not unlinked variants. Unlike many existing ancestral inference methods, STELLS H does not use Monte Carlo approaches when computing the likelihood. For efficient computation, the likelihood model is approximated but still retains much information about population divergence history. STELLS H can find the maximum likelihood population tree based on the approximate likelihood. We show through simulation data and the 1000 Genomes Project data that STELLS H gives reasonably accurate inference results. STELLS H is reasonably efficient for data of current interest and can scale to handle whole-genome data. Availability and implementation: The population tree inference method STELLS H has been implemented as part of the STELLS program", 
  "summary": "A coalescent-based method for population tree inference with haplotypes\nResults: In this article, we propose a new population tree inference method (called STELLSH) based on coalescent likelihood.\nThe main feature of STELLSH is its use of haplotypes rather than individual genetic variations as used in existing population tree inference methods, e.g. Bryant et al (2012) and Pickrell and Pritchard (2012).\nThe main focus of this article is demonstrating that population trees can be inferred relatively accurately and efficiently from haplotypes, and haplotypes may provide more useful information for population tree inference than individual SNPs. There are several features of our new method STELLSH that need more discussion.",

Currently, these targets can only be identified manually, which is time-consuming and usually error-prone. Because of the increasingly frequent occurrences of emerging epidemics and multidrug-resistant 'superbugs', a rapid diagnostic target identification process is needed. Results: A new method that can identify uniquely conserved regions (UCRs) as candidate diagnostic targets for a selected group of organisms solely from their genomic sequences has been developed and successfully tested. Using a sequence-indexing algorithm to identify UCRs and a k-mer integer-mapping model for computational efficiency , this method has successfully identified UCRs within the bacteria domain for 15 test groups, including pathogenic, probiotic, commensal and extremophilic bacterial species or strains. Based on the identified UCRs, new diagnostic primer sets were designed, and their specificity and efficiency were tested by polymerase chain reaction amplifications from both pure isolates and samples containing mixed cultures. Availability and implementation: The UCRs identified for the 15 bacterial species are now freely available at http://ucr.synblex.com.

  "abstract": "Motivation: A major focus of current sequencing studies for human genetics is to identify rare variants associated with complex diseases. Aside from reduced power of detecting associated rare variants, controlling for population stratification is particularly challenging for rare variants. Transmission/disequilibrium tests (TDT) based on family designs are robust to population stratifi-cation and admixture, and therefore provide an effective approach to rare variant association studies to eliminate spurious associations. To increase power of rare variant association analysis, gene-based collapsing methods become standard approaches for analyzing rare variants. Existing methods that extend this strategy to rare variants in families usually combine TDT statistics at individual variants and therefore lack the flexibility of incorporating other genetic models. Results: In this study, we describe a haplotype-based framework for group-wise TDT (gTDT) that is flexible to encompass a variety of genetic models such as additive, dominant and compound heterozygous (CH) (i.e. recessive) models as well as other complex interactions. Unlike existing methods, gTDT constructs haplotypes by transmission when possible and inherently takes into account the linkage disequilibrium among variants. Through extensive simulations we showed that type I error was correctly controlled for rare variants under all models investigated, and this remained true in the presence of population stratification. Under a variety of genetic models, gTDT showed increased power compared with the single marker TDT. Application of gTDT to an autism exome sequencing data of 118 trios identified potentially interesting candidate genes with CH rare variants. Availability and implementation: We implemented gTDT in C\u00fe\u00fe and the source code and the detailed usage are available on the authors' website (https://medschool.", 
  "summary": "The collapsing approaches of rare variants originally developed for unrelated samples have been extended to gene-based TDT and show improved power over single marker TDT while controlling for population stratification/admixture (De et al., 2013; He et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2014), providing a robust approach to rare variant analysis.\nIn this study, we describe a general framework for group-wise TDT (gTDT) for rare variants and implement a few classical genetic models in a user-friendly and computationally efficient tool.\nVariants that are heterozygous in all individuals of a trio are non-informative in single marker tests, but have impact on the type I error of haplotype-based gTDT if not phased correctly.",

Gap genes are responsible for formation of body segments in Drosophila melanogaster embryo during its early development.

However, the model is known to govern the Brownian (non-inertial) motion of particles; hence, it is hardly applicable to the description of protein transport.

Computational prediction of putative ribos-witches can provide direction to molecular biologists studying riboswitch-mediated gene expression.

Riboswitch descriptions are easily modifiable and new ones are easily created. The underlying algorithm converts the problem to a 'heaviest path' problem on a multipartite graph, which is then solved using efficient dynamic programming.

  "abstract": "Motivation: Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) have major roles in the post-transcriptional regulation in prokaryotes. The experimental validation of a relatively small number of sRNAs in few species requires developing computational algorithms capable of robustly encoding the available knowledge and using this knowledge to predict sRNAs within and across species. Results: We present a novel methodology designed to identify bacterial sRNAs by incorporating the knowledge encoded by different sRNA prediction methods and optimally aggregating them as potential pre-dictors. Because some of these methods emphasize specificity, whereas others emphasize sensitivity while detecting sRNAs, their optimal aggregation constitutes trade-off solutions between these two contradictory objectives that enhance their individual merits. Many non-redundant optimal aggregations uncovered by using multiobjec-tive optimization techniques are then combined into a multiclassifier, which ensures robustness during detection and prediction even in gen-omes with distinct nucleotide composition. By training with sRNAs in Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, we were able to successfully predict sRNAs in Sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as in multiple and poorly annotated species. The proposed methodology, like a meta-analysis approach , may begin to lay a possible foundation for developing robust predictive methods across a wide spectrum of genomic variability. Availability and implementation: Scripts created for the experimentation are available at", 
  "summary": "Although several methods have been developed and represent a step forward in the computational detection of sRNAs, their success is limited because of (i) the excessive emphasis on specificity, which generates a high number of false-negative predictions by targeting few well-known sRNA families corresponding only to a small percentage of the available sRNAs, (ii) the use of genomic features (e.g. motifs of terminators, RNA polymerase) that are only conserved in closely related organisms [e.g. E.coli and Salmonella (Argaman et al., 2001; Vogel, 2009)] and thus cause",
