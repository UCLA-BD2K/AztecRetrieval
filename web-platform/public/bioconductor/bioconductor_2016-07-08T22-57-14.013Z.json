As the method is conventionally used on entire omic datasets, such as transcriptomes, it may be dominated by pathways and processes that are substantially represented in a dataset, however the approach may overlook smaller scale, but highly correlated cellular events that may be of great biological relevance. In order to detect these discrete molecular triggers, we developed a tool, co-expressed gene-set enrichment analysis (cogena), for clustering differentially expressed genes and identification of highly correlated molecular expression clusters. Cogena offers the user a range of clustering methods, including hierarchical clustering, model based clustering and self-organised mapping, based on different distance metrics like correlation and mutual information. After obtaining and visualising clusters, cogena performs gene set enrichment. These gene sets can be sourced from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) or user-defined gene sets. By performing gene set enrichment across expression clusters, we find considerable enhancement in the resolution of molecular signatures in omic data at the cluster level compared to the whole.","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/cogena_1.0.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["R (>= 3.2)"," cluster"," ggplot2"," gplots"," amap"],"licenses":["LGPL-3"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["Clustering","GeneSetEnrichment","GeneExpression","Visualization","Pathways","Microarray","Sequencing","SystemsBiology","DataRepresentation","DataImport"],"authors":["Zhilong Jia [aut","Michael Barnes [aut]"],"authorEmails":["",""],"maintainers":["Zhilong Jia "],"maintainerEmails":["zhilongjia@gmail.com"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cancer outlier Gene Profile Sets.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/coGPS/inst/doc/coGPS.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":["Genomics"],"types":["Tool"],"languages":["R"],"source":"BioConductor","sourceID":"coGPS","version":"1.12.0","name":"cancer outlier Gene Profile Sets","description":"Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of P-value based statistics for outlier gene detection in dataset merged from multiple studies","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/coGPS_1.12.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["R (>= 2.13.0)"],"licenses":["GPL-2"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["Microarray","DifferentialExpression"],"authors":["Yingying Wei","Michael Ochs"],"authorEmails":["",""],"maintainers":["Yingying Wei "],"maintainerEmails":["ywei@jhsph.edu"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CpG Island Analysis Pipeline for Illumina Methylation Array and.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/COHCAP/inst/doc/COHCAP.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":["Genomics","Epigenomics"],"types":["Tool"],"languages":["R"],"source":"BioConductor","sourceID":"COHCAP","version":"1.6.0","name":"CpG Island Analysis Pipeline for Illumina Methylation Array and","description":"This package provides a pipeline to analyze single-nucleotide resolution methylation data (Illumina 450k methylation array, targeted BS-Seq, etc.).

To take into account the directionality of gene expression changes, gCMAPQuery introduces the SignedGeneSet class, directly extending GeneSet from the GSEABase package.  To increase performance of large queries, multiple gene sets are stored as sparse incidence matrices within CMAPCollection eSets. gCMAP offers implementations of 1. Fisher's exact test (Fisher, J R Stat Soc, 1922) 2. The \"connectivity map\" method (Lamb et al, Science, 2006) 3. Parametric and non-parametric t-statistic summaries (Jiang & Gentleman, Bioinformatics, 2007) and 4. Wilcoxon / Mann-Whitney rank sum statistics (Wilcoxon, Biometrics Bulletin, 1945) as well as wrappers for the 5. camera (Wu & Smyth, Nucleic Acid Res, 2012) 6. mroast and romer (Wu et al, Bioinformatics, 2010) functions from the limma package and 7. wraps the gsea method from the mgsa package (Bauer et al, NAR, 2010). All methods return CMAPResult objects, an S4 class inheriting from AnnotatedDataFrame, containing enrichment statistics as well as annotation data and providing simple high-level summary plots.","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/gCMAP_1.12.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["GSEABase"," limma (>= 3.20.0)"],"licenses":["Artistic-2.0"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["Microarray","Software","Pathways","Annotation"],"authors":["Thomas Sandmann","Richard Bourgon","Sarah Kummerfeld"],"authorEmails":["sandmann.thomas@gene.com","bourgon.richard@gene.com","kummerfeld.sarah@gene.com"],"maintainers":["Thomas Sandmann "],"maintainerEmails":["sandmann.thomas@gene.com"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/A web interface for gene-set enrichment analyses.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/gCMAPWeb/inst/doc/gCMAPWeb.pdf,","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/gCMAPWeb/inst/doc/referenceDatasets.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":["Genomics"],"types":["Tool"],"languages":["R"],"source":"BioConductor","sourceID":"gCMAPWeb","version":"1.8.0","name":"A web interface for gene-set enrichment analyses","description":"The gCMAPWeb R package provides a graphical user interface for the gCMAP package. gCMAPWeb uses the Rook package and can be used either on a local machine, leveraging R's internal web server, or run on a dedicated rApache web server installation. gCMAPWeb allows users to search their own data sources and instructions to generate reference datasets from public repositories are included with the package. The package supports three common types of analyses, specifically queries with 1. one or two sets of query gene identifiers, whose members are expected to show changes in gene expression in a consistent direction. For example, an up-regulated gene set might contain genes activated by a transcription factor, a down-regulated geneset targets repressed by the same factor. 2. a single set of query gene identifiers, whose members are expected to show divergent differential expression (non-directional query). For example, members of a particular signaling pathway, some of which may be up- some down-regulated in response to a stimulus. 3. a query with the complete results of a differential expression profiling experiment. For example, gene identifiers and z-scores from a previous perturbation experiment. gCMAPWeb accepts three types of identifiers: EntreIds, gene Symbols and microarray probe ids and can be configured to work with any species supported by Bioconductor.

ANCOVA with interaction yields saturated data modelling e.g. different means per group and gene. Covariate adjustment can help to correct for possible selection bias. Variance homogeneity and uncorrelated residuals cannot be expected. Application of ordinary least squares gives unbiased, but no longer optimal estimates (Gauss-Markov-Aitken). Therefore, using the classical F-test is inappropriate, due to correlation. The test statistic however mirrors deviations from the null hypothesis. In combination with a permutation approach, empirical significance levels can be approximated. Alternatively, an approximation yields asymptotic p-values.

Testing is addressed through several test statistics: global likelihood ratio test (E2), Bartholomew 1961, Barlow et al. 1972 and Robertson et al. 1988), Williams (1971, 1972), Marcus (1976), the M (Hu et al. 2005) and the modified M (Lin et al. 2007).

The inference is based on resampling methods, which control the False Discovery Rate (FDR), for both permutations (Ge et al., 2003) and the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM, Tusher et al., 2001).

As core functionality, kebabs implements following sequence kernels: spectrum kernel, mismatch kernel, gappy pair kernel, and motif kernel. Apart from an efficient implementation of standard position-independent functionality, the kernels are extended in a novel way to take the position of patterns into account for the similarity measure. Because of the flexibility of the kernel formulation, other kernels like the weighted degree kernel or the shifted weighted degree kernel with constant weighting of positions are included as special cases. An annotation-specific variant of the kernels uses annotation information placed along the sequence together with the patterns in the sequence. The package allows for the generation of a kernel matrix or an explicit feature representation in dense or sparse format for all available kernels which can be used with methods implemented in other R packages. With focus on SVM-based methods, kebabs provides a framework which simplifies the usage of existing SVM implementations in kernlab, e1071, and LiblineaR. Binary and multi-class classification as well as regression tasks can be used in a unified way without having to deal with the different functions, parameters, and formats of the selected SVM. As support for choosing hyperparameters, the package provides cross validation - including grouped cross validation, grid search and model selection functions.

We are able to reduce the computational burden and granularity issues of permutation testing with our method, which is implemented in this package. npGSEA calculates gene set enrichment statistics and p-values without the computational cost of permutations.  It is applicable in settings where one or many gene sets are of interest.  There are also built-in plotting functions to help users visualize results.","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/npGSEA_1.4.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["GSEABase (>= 1.24.0)"],"licenses":["Artistic-2.0"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["GeneSetEnrichment","Microarray","StatisticalMethod","Pathways"],"authors":["Jessica Larson","Art Owen"],"authorEmails":["",""],"maintainers":["Jessica Larson "],"maintainerEmails":["larson.jess@gmail.com"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Predict gene network using an Ordinary Differential Equation.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/NTW/inst/doc/NTW.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":[],"types":["Tool"],"languages":["R"],"source":"BioConductor","sourceID":"NTW","version":"1.18.0","name":"Predict gene network using an Ordinary Differential Equation","description":"This package predicts the gene-gene interaction network and identifies the direct transcriptional targets of the perturbation using an ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) based method.","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/NTW_1.18.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["R (>= 2.3.0)"],"licenses":["GPL-2"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["Preprocessing"],"authors":["Wei Xiao","Yin Jin","Darong Lai","Xinyi Yang","Yuanhua Liu","Christine Nardini"],"authorEmails":["","","","","",""],"maintainers":["Yuanhua Liu "],"maintainerEmails":["liuyuanhua@picb.ac.cn"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Nucleosome positioning package for R.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/nucleR/inst/doc/nucleR.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":["Genomics"],"types":["Tool"],"languages":["R"],"source":"BioConductor","sourceID":"nucleR","version":"2.0.0","name":"Nucleosome positioning package for R","description":"Nucleosome positioning for Tiling Arrays and NGS experiments.","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/nucleR_2.0.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["ShortRead"],"licenses":["LGPL (>= 3)"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["ChIPSeq","Microarray","Sequencing","Genetics"],"authors":["Oscar Flores","Ricard Illa"],"authorEmails":["",""],"maintainers":["Ricard Illa "],"maintainerEmails":["ricard.illa@irbbarcelona.org"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Normal Uniform Differential Gene Expression detection.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/nudge/inst/doc/nudge.vignette.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":["Genomics"],"types":["Tool"],"languages":["R"],"source":"BioConductor","sourceID":"nudge","version":"1.34.0","name":"Normal Uniform Differential Gene Expression detection","description":"Package for normalizing microarray data in single and multiple replicate experiments and fitting a normal-uniform mixture to detect differentially expressed genes in the cases where the two samples are being compared directly or indirectly (via a common reference sample)","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/nudge_1.34.0.tar.gz","dependencies":[""],"licenses":["GPL-2"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["Microarray","TwoChannel","DifferentialExpression"],"authors":["N.

To minimize batch effects, a careful experiment design should ensure the even distribution of biological groups and confounding factors across batches. OSAT (Optimal Sample Assignment Tool) is developed to facilitate the allocation of collected samples to different batches. With minimum steps, it produces setup that optimizes the even distribution of samples in groups of biological interest into different batches, reducing the confounding or correlation between batches and the biological variables of interest. It can also optimize the even distribution of confounding factors across batches. Our tool can handle challenging instances where incomplete and unbalanced sample collections are involved as well as ideal balanced RCBD.

In addition, rather than simply evaluating the deviation from a null hypothesis with a single number (a P value), qusage quantifies gene set activity with a complete probability density function (PDF).

Preserving the PDF also allows for post-hoc analysis (e.g., pair-wise comparisons of gene set activity) while maintaining statistical traceability.

NB: in the paper, we used ProMISe as both the model name and inferred score name.","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/Roleswitch_1.6.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["R (>= 2.10)"," pracma"," reshape"," plotrix"," microRNA"," biomaRt"," Biostrings"," Biobase"," DBI"],"licenses":["GPL-2"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["miRNA"],"authors":["Yue Li"],"authorEmails":[""],"maintainers":["Yue Li "],"maintainerEmails":["yueli@cs.toronto.edu"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Statistical analysis of Solexa sequencing data.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/Rolexa/inst/doc/Rolexa-vignette.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":[],"types":["Tool"],"languages":["R"],"source":"BioConductor","sourceID":"Rolexa","version":"1.24.0","name":"Statistical analysis of Solexa sequencing data","description":"Provides probabilistic base calling, quality checks and diagnostic plots for Solexa sequencing data","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/Rolexa_1.24.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["R (>= 2.9.0)"," graphics"," grDevices"," methods"," ShortRead"],"licenses":["GPL-2"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["Sequencing","DataImport","Preprocessing","QualityControl"],"authors":["Jacques Rougemont","Arnaud Amzallag","Christian Iseli","Laurent Farinelli","Ioannis Xenarios","Felix Naef"],"authorEmails":["","","","","",""],"maintainers":["Jacques Rougemont "],"maintainerEmails":["jacques.rougemont@epfl.ch"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/An R interface to the Ontology Lookup Service.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/rols/inst/doc/rols.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":[],"types":["Tool"],"languages":["R"],"source":"BioConductor","sourceID":"rols","version":"1.10.0","name":"An R interface to the Ontology Lookup Service","description":"This package allows to query EBI's Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP).","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/rols_1.10.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["methods"],"licenses":["GPL-2"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["Software","Annotation","MassSpectrometry","GO"],"authors":["Laurent Gatto"],"authorEmails":["lg390@cam.ac.uk"],"maintainers":["Laurent Gatto "],"maintainerEmails":["lg390@cam.ac.uk"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/R Onto-Tools suite.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ROntoTools/inst/doc/rontotools.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":["Genomics"],"types":["Tool"],"languages":["R"],"source":"BioConductor","sourceID":"ROntoTools","version":"1.8.1","name":"R Onto-Tools suite","description":"Suite of tools for functional analysis","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/ROntoTools_1.8.1.tar.gz","dependencies":["methods"," graph"," boot"," KEGGREST"," KEGGgraph"," Rgraphviz"],"licenses":["CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 + file LICENSE"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["NetworkAnalysis","Microarray","GraphsAndNetworks"],"authors":["Calin Voichita","Sorin Draghici"],"authorEmails":["calin@wayne.edu","sorin@wayne.edu"],"maintainers":["Calin Voichita "],"maintainerEmails":["calin@wayne.edu"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","bug"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RPA: Robust Probabilistic Averaging for probe-level analysis.html","https://github.com/antagomir/RPA"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":["Genomics"],"types":["Tool"],"languages":["R"],"source":"BioConductor","sourceID":"RPA","version":"1.24.0","name":"RPA: Robust Probabilistic Averaging for probe-level analysis","description":"Probabilistic analysis of probe reliability and differential gene expression on short oligonucleotide arrays.

Next, the same procedure is applied to randomly generated gene sets, and P_random is calculated as the proportion achieving a P_pure as significant as the candidate gene set.

The output of seq2pathway is a general structure of quantitative pathway-level scores, thus allowing one to functional interpret such datasets as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, GWAS, and derived from other next generational sequencing experiments.","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/seq2pathway_1.0.1.tar.gz","dependencies":["R (>=

The data are visualized as average signal profile plot, with error estimates (standard error and 95% confidence interval) shown as fields, or as series of heatmaps that can be sorted and clustered using hierarchical clustering, k-means algorithm and self organising maps. Plots can be prepared using R programming language or web browser based graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using Shiny framework. The dual-purpose implementation allows running the software locally on desktop or deploying it on server. SeqPlots is useful for both for exploratory data analyses and preparing replicable, publication quality plots. Other features of the software include collaboration and data sharing capabilities, as well as ability to store pre-calculated result matrixes, that combine many sequencing experiments and in-silico generated tracks with multiple different features. These binaries can be further used to generate new combination plots on fly, run automated batch operations or share with colleagues, who can adjust their plotting parameters without loading actual tracks and recalculating numeric values.

Reconstructed models can be used to better characterise genotype-phenotype relation, and suggest novel targets for therapy design. TRONCO (TRanslational ONCOlogy) is a R package aimed at collecting state-of-the-art algorithms to infer progression models from cross-sectional data, i.e., data collected from independent patients which does not necessarily incorporate any evident temporal information. These algorithms require a binary input matrix where: (i) each row represents a patient genome, (ii) each column an event relevant to the progression (a priori selected) and a 0/1 value models the absence/presence of a certain mutation in a certain patient. The current first version of TRONCO implements the CAPRESE algorithm (Cancer PRogression Extraction with Single Edges) to infer possible progression models arranged as trees; cfr.
